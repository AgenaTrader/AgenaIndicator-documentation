            "text": "Data\n\n\nIn this context, data is understood as information loaded from outside sources as well as data sets originating from internally generated AgenaScripts.\n\n\nBars (Candles)\n\n\nModus Operandi\n\n\nA classical indicator will calculate one or multiple values using the available data series.\n\n\nData series in this sense can consist of closing prices, lows, hourly charts or 10-minute periods etc.\nEach period (candle) will be assigned to a specific indicator(s).\n\n\nIn the following examples and illustrations, we will assume an indicator value generated by something like a simple moving average.\n\n\nTo calculate a moving average, AgenaTrader needs a data series; for this we will use the closing prices. All closing prices for the bars (candles) within a chart will be saved in a list and numerically ordered.\n\n\nThe current closing price of the current bar will be displayed on the right edge of the chart and will be assigned the number 0. The bar to the left of it is assigned the number 1 and so on. The oldest displayed bar will have the number 500 (as an example).\n\n\nIf a new bar is added during the current trading session, then this bar will be assigned the number 0, and the previous bar \u2013 which up to that point was bar number 0 \u2013 will now be reassigned as bar 1, and the oldest bar to the very left will have the number 501.\n\n\nWithin a script (self-created program), the \u201cClose\" array is the list of all closing prices. The last closing price is thus Close[0] and the preceding closing price (bar to the left of the last bar) is Close[1] and so on, with the oldest candle having the value of Close[501]. The number within the square brackets here clearly denotes the index of the array. The general term used within AgenaTrader is \u201cbarsAgo\".\n\n\nIn addition, each bar will not only have a close value, but also a \nHigh\n, \nLow\n, \nOpen\n, \nMedian\n, \nTypical\n, \nWeighted\n, \nTime\n and \nVolume\n. On a daily period timeframe, the high of the candle that occurred 10 periods ago would be High[10]; the low of the last day would be Low[1].\n\n\nImportant note:\n\nThe examples mentioned concern calculations that are performed at the end of a period. The values for the currently running and unfinished candles are not taken into consideration.\n\n\nIf you want the values of the currently running and unfinished candles, you will need to set CalculateOnBarClose = false. As with the previous example, the currently running bar will receive the number 0 and so on.\nClose[0] will provide you with the most recent price transmitted by the data provider. All values of the bars High[0]\u2026Low[0]\u2026 etc. are subject to change until the bar has been finalized and a new bar has begun. The only value that will definitely not change is Open[0].\n\n\nData Series\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nAgenaTrader differentiates between data series used for your self-programmed definitions that will hold values of various types, and on the other hand, data series which are the standard integrated series containing market data and price data for the individual data.\nThe concept of data series is followed up consistently and continuously. All price data for individual bars are organized within the data series.\n\n\nThe following data series are available:\n\n\nOpen\n\n\nHigh\n\n\nLow\n\n\nClose\n\n\nMedian\n\n\nTypical\n\n\nWeighted\n \nWeighteds\n\n\nTime\n \nTimes\n\n\nTimeFrame\n \nTimeFrames\n\n\nVolume\n \nVolumes\n\n\nOpen\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nOpen is the data series in which the historical opening prices are saved.\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nbarsAgo Index value (see \nBars\n)\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nOpen\nOpen[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nMore information\n\n\nThe outputted value depends on the property \nCalculateOnBarClose\n.\n\n\nExample\n\n\n// Opening price of the current period\nPrint(Time[0] + \n \n + Open[0]);\n\n// Opening price of the bar that occurred 5 periods ago\nPrint(Time[5] + \n \n + Open[5]);\n\n// Current value of the SMA 14 above the opening price (rounded)\nPrint(\nSMA(14) Calculated using the opening prices: \n + Instrument.Round2TickSize(SMA(Open, 14)[0]));\n\n\n\n\nHigh\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nHigh is the data series in which the historical highs are saved.\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nbarsAgo Index value (see \nBars\n)\n\n\nusage\n\n\nHigh\nHigh[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nMore information\n\n\nThe outputted value depends on the property \nCalculateOnBarClose\n.\n\n\nExample\n\n\n// High price of the current period\nPrint(Time[0] + \n \n + High[0]);\n\n// High price of the bar 5 periods ago\nPrint(Time[5] + \n \n + High[5]);\n\n// Current value for the SMA 14 using the high prices (rounded)\nPrint(\nSMA(14) calculated using the high values: \n + Instrument.Round2TickSize(SMA(High, 14)[0]));\n\n\n\n\nLow\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nLow is the data series in which all historical lows are saved.\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nbarsAgo Index value (see \nBars\n)\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nLow\nLow[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nMore information\n\n\nThe outputted value depends on the property \nCalculateOnBarClose\n.\n\n\nExample\n\n\n// Low prices of the current period\nPrint(Time[0] + \n \n + Low[0]);\n\n// Low prices of the bar 5 periods ago\nPrint(Time[5] + \n \n + Low[5]);\n\n// Current value for the SMA 14 calculated using the low prices\nPrint(\nSMA(14) calculated using the low prices: \n + Instrument.Round2TickSize(SMA(Low, 14)[0]));\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nClose is the data series in which all historical closing prices are saved.\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nbarsAgo Index value (see \nBars\n)\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nClose\nClose[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nMore information\n\n\nThe outputted value depends on the property \nCalculateOnBarClose\n.\n\n\nIndicators are generally calculated using the closing prices.

The last closing price is thus Close[0] and the preceding closing price (bar to the left of the last bar) is Close[1] and so on, with the oldest candle having the value of Close[501]. The number within the square brackets here clearly denotes the index of the array. The general term used within AgenaTrader is \u201cbarsAgo\".  In addition, each bar will not only have a close value, but also a  High ,  Low ,  Open ,  Median ,  Typical ,  Weighted ,  Time  and  Volume . On a daily period timeframe, the high of the candle that occurred 10 periods ago would be High[10]; the low of the last day would be Low[1].  Important note: \nThe examples mentioned concern calculations that are performed at the end of a period. The values for the currently running and unfinished candles are not taken into consideration.  If you want the values of the currently running and unfinished candles, you will need to set CalculateOnBarClose = false. As with the previous example, the currently running bar will receive the number 0 and so on.\nClose[0] will provide you with the most recent price transmitted by the data provider. All values of the bars High[0]\u2026Low[0]\u2026 etc. are subject to change until the bar has been finalized and a new bar has begun. The only value that will definitely not change is Open[0].",

If the ADL is falling in a downward trend, money is being taken out of the stock, thus confirming the downtrend.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nvtadwiki.vtad.de\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nADL()\nADL(IDataSeries input)\nADL()[int barsAgo]\nADL(IDataSeries input)[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using the method with an index (e.g. ADL()[int barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be outputted for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameter\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Testing the direction of the ADL\nif (IsSerieRising(ADL())\nPrint(\nThe ADL indicator is rising.\n);\n\n\n\n\nAdaptive Price Zone (APZ)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis is a technical indicator developed by Lee Leibfarth in 2006. The Adaptive Price Zone is a volatility-based indicator shown as a set of bands laid over a price chart. The APZ, which is particularly useful in non-trending, choppy markets, was developed with the aim of helping traders to find potential turning points in the markets. The APZ is based on a short-term, double-smoothed EMA that reacts rapidly to price changes with reduced lag. It works in the following way: the bands create a channel that envelopes the average price and tracks price changes. If the price crosses over the upper band of the zone, this creates an opportunity for the trader to trade a reversal. For the lower band, the reverse is true.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe bigger the price movement, the greater the distance between the upper and lower band will be. The smaller the price movement, the smaller the distance between the bands. More widely spaced bands will indicate increased instability and volatility, whereas closely tuned bands will display reduced volatility. If the price action breaks through the upper or lower band then the APZ will tend to return to its statistical average. This will lead to trading opportunities where the market may try to compensate for imbalances. If the price overshoots the bands for example, as mentioned in the description, then this will present you with a trading opportunity in the opposite direction.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nhttp://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/10/adaptive-price-zone-indicator-explained.asp\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nAPZ(double barPct, int period)\nAPZ(IDataSeries input, double barPct, int period)\nUpper Band\nAPZ(double barPct, int period).Upper[int barsAgo]\nAPZ(IDataSeries input, double barPct, int period).Upper[int barsAgo]\nLower Band\nAPZ(double barPct, int period).Lower[int barsAgo]\nAPZ(IDataSeries input, double barPct, int period).Lower[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using the method with an index (e.g. \nAPZ\n(2, 20)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be outputted for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\nbarPct Standard deviation\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculation\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output for the current values for the upper and lower band of a 20-period APZ\nPrint(\nValue for the upper APZ band : \n + APZ(2, 20).Upper[0]);\nPrint(\nValue for the lower APZ band: \n + APZ(2, 20).Lower[0]);\n\n\n\n\nAroon\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nAroon, an indicator system that determines whether or not a stock is trending and how strong this trend is, was developed by Tushar Chande in 1995. Its name is derived from the Sanskrit \u201cdawn\u2019s early light\u201d. Chande used this name to signify the indicators\u2019 purpose of revealing the start of a new trend. These indicators measure the number of periods since the last time the price recorded an x-day high or low. There are two distinct indicators: the Aroon-Up and Aroon-Down, whereby a 50-day Aroon-Up measures the number of days since a 50-day high, and a 50-day Aroon-Down measures the days since a 50-day low. This makes the Aroon indicators significantly different from the usual momentum oscillators, which concentrate on price in relation to time. What makes Aroon indicators unique is that they focus on time in relation to price. Aroon indicators can be used to detect emerging trends, identify consolidations, anticipate reversals and define correction periods.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe Aroon indicators fluctuate above/below a centerline (50) and are bound between 0 and 100. These three levels are important for interpretation. At its most basic, the bulls have the edge when Aroon-Up is above 50 and Aroon-Down is below 50. This indicates a greater propensity for new x-day highs than lows. The converse is true for a downtrend. The bears have the edge when Aroon-Up is below 50 and Aroon-Down is above 50.\n\n\nA surge to 100 indicates that a trend may be emerging. This can be confirmed with a decline in the other Aroon indicator. For example, a move to 100 in Aroon-Up combined with a decline below 30 in Aroon-Down shows upside strength. Consistently high readings mean prices are regularly hitting new highs or new lows for the specified period. Prices are moving consistently higher when Aroon-Up remains in the 70-100 range for an extended period. Conversely, consistently low readings indicate that prices are seldom hitting new highs or lows. Prices are NOT moving lower when Aroon-Down remains in the 0-30 range for an extended period. This does not mean prices are moving higher though. For that we need to check Aroon-Up.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nhttp://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:aroon\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nAroon(int period)\nAroon(IDataSeries input, int period)\n//For the upper value\nAroon(int period).Up[int barsAgo]\nAroon(IDataSeries input, int period).Up[int barsAgo]\n//For the lower value\nAroon(int period).Down[int barsAgo]\nAroon(IDataSeries input, int period).Down[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nAroon\n(20)[\nint\n barsAgo] ) the value of the indicator will be displayed for the last referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars taken into consideration when calculating the values\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output of the current up or down values for the 20 period Aroon\nPrint(\nCurrent value for Aroon Up is : \n + Aroon(20).Up[0]);\nPrint(\nCurrent value for Aroon Down is: \n + Aroon(20).Down[0]);\n\n\n\n\nAroon Oscillator\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis oscillator is calculated by subtracting the Aroon-Down from the Aroon-Up. Usually, these two indicators are plotted next to each other for easy comparison, but traders can also view the difference between the two indicators using the Aroon oscillator, which can fluctuate between -100 and +100, with zero as the middle line. When the oscillator is positive, this indicates a bullish trend bias, whilst when the oscillator is negative, this shows a bearish trend bias. Chartists also have the option to extend the bull-bear threshold to spot stronger signals.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe Aroon Oscillator is ideally used as a trend filter and trend strength indicator.

Wilder designed ADX with daily prices and commodities in mind; however, these indicators can also be applied to stocks. The Average Directional Index measures the trend strength without taking trend direction into account, while the -DI and +DI complement the ADX by defining the trend direction. When used together, traders can find out both the direction and the strength of the trend.\n\n\nWilder talks about the Directional Movement indicators in his 1978 book, New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems, which also features details of Average True Range (ATR), the Parabolic SAR system and the RSI. Although he developed them before the computer age, Wilder\u2019s indicators are extremely detailed in their calculation and are still equally effective today.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe Average Directional Index (ADX) is used to measure the strength or weakness of a trend, not the actual direction. Directional movement is defined by +DI and -DI. In general, the bulls have the edge when +DI is greater than -DI, while the bears have the edge when -DI is greater. Crosses of these directional indicators can be combined with ADX for a complete trading system.\n\n\nIt should be kept in mind that Wilder was a commodity and currency trader. The examples in his books are based on these instruments, not stocks. This does not mean his indicators cannot be used with stocks. Some stocks have price characteristics similar to commodities, which tend to be more volatile with short and strong trends. Stocks with low volatility may not generate signals based on Wilder's parameters. Chartists will likely need to adjust the indicator settings or the signal parameters according to the characteristics of the security.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nhttp://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_Directional_Movement_Index\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nADX(int period)\nADX(IDataSeries input, int period)\nADX(int period)[int barsAgo]\nADX(IDataSeries input, int period)[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nADX\n(20)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be outputted for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculation\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output of the current value of a 20 period ADX\nPrint(\nValue of the ADX: \n + ADX(20)[0]);\n\n\n\n\nAverage Directional Movement Rating (ADXR)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe ADXR is the ADX indicator plus the ADX from n days ago divided by 2. Written as an equation, it looks like this: (current ADX + ADX n days ago) / 2.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe oscillator moves along a guiding line that typically has a value of 20. When the ADXR rises above 20, a trend exists. If the ADXR is below 20, no trend exists and the market is moving sideways.\nWelles Wilder recommends buying into the market at a value of 25 and higher, and holding the position as long as the value remains above 20.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nADXR(int interval, int period)\nADXR(IDataSeries input, int interval, int period)\nADXR(int interval, int period)[int barsAgo]\nADXR(IDataSeries input, int interval, int period)[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nADXR\n(10, 14)[\nint\n barsAgo]), the value of the indicator will be outputted for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\ninterval Interval between the first ADX value and the current ADX value\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculation\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output of the current value of the ADXR\nPrint(\nValue of the ADXR: \n + ADXR(10, 14)[0]);\n\n\n\n\nAverage True Range (ATR)\n\n\nDescription \n Interpretation\n\n\nThe Average True Range (ATR), which was developed by J. Welles Wilder, is an indicator that measures volatility. As is true for most of his indicators, Wilder designed the ATR with commodities and daily prices in mind. Commodities are often more volatile than stocks, and frequently experience gaps and limit moves, which happen when a commodity opens up or down its maximum allowed move for the session. A volatility formula that was based on the high-low range only would be unable to capture volatility from gap or limit moves. Wilder, therefore, developed the Average True Range to capture this \"missing\" volatility. Keep in mind that ATR does not provide an indication of price direction, but merely volatility.\n\n\nThe ATR is featured in Wilder\u2019s 1978 book, New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems, which also goes into detail about the Parabolic SAR, RSI and the Directional Movement Concept (ADX). Despite having been developed before the computer age, Wilder's indicators are equally functional today and remain extremely popular.\n\n\nThe starting point for Wilder was a concept called \nTrue Range (TR)\n, which is defined as the greatest of the following:\n-   Method 1: current high minus the current low\n-   Method 2: current high minus the previous close (absolute value)\n-   Method 3: current Low minus the previous close (absolute value)\n\n\nAbsolute values are used for ensuring positive numbers, since Wilder was interested in measuring the distance between two points, not the direction. If the current period's high is above the prior period's high and the low is below the prior period's low, then the current period's high-low range will be used as the True Range. This is an outside day that would use method 1 to calculate the TR, and is quite straightforward. Methods 2 and 3 are used whenever there is a gap or inside day. A gap occurs when the previous close is greater than the current high (indicating a potential gap down or limit move) or the previous close is lower than the current low (indicating a potential gap up or limit move). The image below shows examples of when methods 2 and 3 are appropriate.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nVTAD: \nhttp://vtadwiki.vtad.de/index.php/Average_True_Range\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nATR(int period)\nATR(IDataSeries input, int period)\nATR(int period)[int barsAgo]\nATR(IDataSeries input, int period)[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nATR\n(14)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be outputted for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculation\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output of the current value of a 14 period ATR\nPrint(\nThe current ATR value is: \n + ATR(14)[0]);\n\n\n\n\nBalance of Power (BOP)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe developer of the Balance of Power indicator was Igor Livshin, who came up with the BOP in August 2001. The BOP indicator represents the strength of the buyers (bulls) vs. the sellers (bears), and oscillates between -100 and 100. The calculation of the BOP = (close - open) / (high - low).\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nA directional change of the BOP can be interpreted as a warning signal and will generally be followed by a price change.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nBOP(int smooth)\nBOP(IDataSeries input, int smooth)\nBOP(int smooth)[int barsAgo]\nBOP(IDataSeries input, int smooth)[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nBOP\n(5)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be outputted for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nsmooth Settings for the smoothing\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output of the value for the BOP with a smoothing of 5 periods\nPrint(\nThe Balance of Power value is: \n + BOP(5));\n\n\n\n\nBollinger Bands\n\n\nDescription \n Interpretation\n\n\nBollinger Bands\u00ae, which were developed by John Bollinger, are volatility bands that are placed above and below a moving average. The volatility is based on the standard deviation, which fluctuates as volatility increases and decreases. An increase in volatility causes the bands to automatically widen, and a decrease in volatility causes them to automatically narrow. The Bollinger Bands\u2019 dynamic nature means that they can also be used on different securities with the standard settings. When it comes to signals, Bollinger Bands can be used to identify M-Tops and W-Bottoms, or for determining a trend\u2019s strength.\n\n\nBollinger Bands are made up of a middle band with two outer bands.\n The middle band is a simple moving average that is normally set to 20 periods. The reason a simple moving average is used is that the standard deviation formula also uses a simple moving average. The look-back period for the standard deviation is the same as for the simple moving average. The outer bands are generally set 2 standard deviations above and below the middle band, but settings can be adjusted to suit the characteristics of specific securities or trading styles. Bollinger recommends making small, incremental adjustments to the standard deviation multiplier. Changing the number of periods for the moving average also has an effect on the number of periods used to calculate the standard deviation, which is why only small adjustments are required for the standard deviation multiplier. An increase in the moving average period would also automatically increase the number of periods used for calculating the standard deviation, as well as warranting an increase in the standard deviation multiplier. With a 20-day SMA and 20-day Standard Deviation, the standard deviation multiplier is set at 2. Bollinger recommends increasing the standard deviation multiplier to 2.1 for a 50-period SMA and decreasing the standard deviation multiplier to 1.9 for a 10-period SMA.\n\nBollinger Bands reflect direction with the 20-period SMA and volatility with the upper/lower bands\n. This means that they can be used to determine whether prices are relatively high or low. Bollinger maintains that the bands should contain 88-89% of price action, rendering a move outside the bands very significant. Technically, prices are relatively high when above the upper band and relatively low when below the lower band. However, relatively high should not be seen as bearish or as a sell signal. Likewise, relatively low should not be regarded as bullish or as a buy signal, since prices are high or low for a reason. As with other indicators, Bollinger Bands are not designed to be used as a stand-alone tool. Traders should combine Bollinger Bands with basic trend analysis and other indicators to confirm a trend.\n\n\nThe calculation is performed in the following manner:\n\n\nUpper band = middle band + 2 standard deviations\nMiddle band = average of 20 periods\nLower band = middle period \u2013 2 standard deviations\n\n\nMore information can be found here: \nBollingerMTF\n, \nBollinger Percent %B\n, \nBollinger Bands Width\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nVTAD: \nhttp://vtadwiki.vtad.de/index.php/Bollinger_B%C3%A4nder\n\n\nBook \"Technische Indikatoren - simplified\" by Oliver Paesler (German only)\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nBollinger(double numStdDev, int period)\nBollinger(IDataSeries input, double numStdDev, int period)\n//For the upper band\nBollinger(double numStdDev, int period).Upper[int barsAgo]\nBollinger(IDataSeries input, double numStdDev, int period).Upper[int barsAgo]\n//For the lower band\nBollinger(double numStdDev, int period).Lower[int barsAgo]\nBollinger(IDataSeries input, double numStdDev, int period).Lower[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nBollinger\n(2, 20)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be displayed for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nnumStdDev Standard deviation\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculation\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output of the value for the upper Bollinger Band\nPrint(\nValue of the upper band: \n + Bollinger(2, 20).Upper[0]);\n//Middle band\nPrint(\nValue of the middle band: \n + Bollinger(2, 20)[0]);\n//Lower band\nPrint(\nValue of the lower band: \n + Bollinger(2, 20).Lower[0]);\n\n\n\n\nBollinger Percent B (%b)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nBollinger %b is an important indicator that is derived from John Bollinger's original Bollinger Bands indicator. %b represents the location of the most recent close price in relation to the Bollinger Bands as well as to what degree it is above or below any of the bands. The Bollinger Percent B equation can be constructed in the following way: Percent B = ((Close - Bollinger Lower Band) / (Bollinger Upper Band - Bollinger Lower Band)) * 100. If the close price is the same as the upper Bollinger Band, %b will be 100 (percent). If the close price is the same as the lower Bollinger Band, %b will be 0.0 (percent). A %b value of 50 indicates that the close price is equal to the middle Bollinger Band. What is more, readings above 100 and below 0 show that the close price is outside of the Bollinger Bands by a corresponding percentage of the Bollinger Bandwidth. A %b value of 125 means that the close price is above the upper Bollinger Band by 25% of the Bandwidth, while a %b value of -25 means that the close price is below the lower Bollinger Band by 25% of the Bandwidth.\n\n\nSee \nBollinger Bands\n, \nBBWidth\n\n\nAn additional application: normalizing indicators\n\n\nBollinger bands, and therefore the %b indicator, can be applied not only to the prices of stocks, futures etc., but also to time series with fundamental data, volume data and other indicators. This is particularly interesting when you need to know whether a value is relatively high or low \u2013 in this case, the %b indicator offers you a different perspective. If you wish to find out whether the volume of a stock is exceedingly high or low, you can simply apply it to the volume data. John Bollinger regards the application of the %b onto other indicators as one of the most important aspects of the indicator. If you wish to normalize an indicator with %b, it is important to first calculate the indicator (e.g. the RSI) with the help of the %b for the calculation of the indicator instead of the price data. The application of the %b essentially works in the same way as the application of Bollinger bands onto the indicator itself. The intersection points between the bands and the indicators will therefore be 1 and 0. In principle, the relative position of the original indicator is displayed in relation to its upper and lower bands. This means that the boundaries of the original indicator will be removed. John Bollinger himself wrote: \u201cYou\u2019re defining a high or low point on a relative basis, this may allow you to gain a deeper insight and understanding not provided by traditional indicators and guidelines.\u201d John Bollinger provides several parameters for the %b calculation, such as 40-day periods and a factor of 2.0 for a 9-day RSI, and a 50-day period with a factor of 2.1 for the calculation of %b.\n\n\n(Sources: Oliver Paesler: \"Technische Indikatoren - simplified\" and John Bollinger: \"Bollinger B\u00e4nder\")\n\n\n(Source: \ntradesignalonline\n)\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nVTAD: \nhttp://vtadwiki.vtad.de/index.php/Bollinger_B%C3%A4nder\n\n\nBook \"Technische Indikatoren - simplified\" by Oliver Paesler (German only)\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nBollingerPercentB(int period, double numStdDev)\nBollingerPercentB(IDataSeries input, int period, double numStdDev)\nBollingerPercentB(int period, double numStdDev) [int barsAgo]\nBollingerPercentB(IDataSeries input, int period, double numStdDev)[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nBollingerPercentB\n(20, 2)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be outputted for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculation\n\n\nnumStdDev Standard deviation\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output for the value of Bollinger %B\n\n\nPrint\n(\"Value of the Bollinger Percent B is: \" + \nBollingerPercentB\n(20, 2)[0]);\n\n\nBollinger Band Width (BBWidth)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis indicator is derived from Bollinger Bands. John Bollinger refers to Bollinger Band Width as one of two indicators that one can derive from Bollinger Bands; the other indicator is %B.\nThe Band Width measures the percentage difference between the upper and the lower band. It decreases as Bollinger Bands narrow, and increases as they widen. Since Bollinger Bands are based on the standard deviation, falling Band Width reflects decreasing volatility and rising Band Width reflects the opposite.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nJohn Bollinger uses the Band Width to recognize rising and falling trends. Most trends have their origins within sideway market movements that generally have a low volatility. If a breakout is accompanied by a sudden rise in the Band Width, this means that there is definite support for the move.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nVTAD: \nhttp://vtadwiki.vtad.de/index.php/Bollinger_B%C3%A4nder\n\n\nBook \"Technische Indikatoren - simplified\" by Oliver Paesler (German only)\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nBBWidth(double numStdDev, int period)\nBBWidth(IDataSeries input, double numStdDev, int period)\nBBWidth(double numStdDev, int period)[int barsAgo]\nBBWidth(IDataSeries input, double numStdDev, int period)[int barsAgo]\n\n//For the value of the upper Band Width\nBBWidth(double numStdDev, int period).BandWidth\nBBWidth(IDataSeries input, double numStdDev, int period).BandWidth\nBBWidth(double numStdDev, int period).BandWidth[int barsAgo]\nBBWidth(IDataSeries input, double numStdDev, int period).BandWidth[int barsAgo]\n\n//For the value of the trigger line (threshold)\nBBWidth(double numStdDev, int period).Threshold\nBBWidth(IDataSeries input, double numStdDev, int period).Threshold\nBBWidth(double numStdDev, int period).Threshold[int barsAgo]\nBBWidth(IDataSeries input, double numStdDev, int period).Threshold[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using the method with an index (e.g. \nBBWidth\n(2, 20)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be outputted for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculation\n\n\nnumStdDev Standard deviation\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output for the values of Bollinger Band Width\nPrint(\nThe value of the Bollinger Band Width is: \n + BBWidth(2, 20).BandWidth[0]);\n//Output for the values for the signal line\nPrint(\nThe value of the signal line is: \n + BBWidth(2, 20).Threshold[0]);\n\n\n\n\nBollinger MTF (MultiTimeFrame)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Bollinger MTF is the multi-timeframe version of the Bollinger Bands, and its main use is in intraday trading.

Into the stock = accumulation, and out of the stock = distribution. Clearly, this applies not only to stocks/shares but also to other instruments. With this, Chaikin attempts to expand on and improve the On-Balance Volume that was developed by Granville. Using the CMF, the position of the closing price within the trading range is placed in relation to the volume. What this essentially means is that the trading volume is multiplied by the price. The trading volume displays the amount of money that has \u201cflowed\u201d into the stock or has been \u201cremoved\u201d from the stock; the indicator simply displays whether it has been accumulated (buying pressure) or removed (distribution).\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe CMF oscillates around the zero line and is shown in a separate window with an open scale. Should the CMF be located above the zero line, then it can be interpreted as accumulation. If higher highs are being created, then the buying pressure is increasing. The reverse is true for the selling pressure. The Chaikin Money Flow should always be used in combination with other methods of technical analysis.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nVTAD: \nhttp://vtadwiki.vtad.de/index.php/Chaikin_Money_Flow\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nChaikinMoneyFlow(int period)\nChaikinMoneyFlow(IDataSeries input, int period)\nChaikinMoneyFlow(int period)[int barsAgo]\nChaikinMoneyFlow(IDataSeries input, int period)[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nChaikinMoneyFlow\n(21)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be outputted for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculation\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output for the Money Flow value\nPrint(\nThe Chaikin Money Flow value is: \n + ChaikinMoneyFlow(21)[0]);\n\n\n\n\nChaikin Oscillator\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Chaikin Oscillator is a volume indicator that lets the trader know whether new highs are also accompanied by new volumes. This oscillator is a simple MACD that is applied to the accumulation/distribution line. Hereby, the difference between a 3-day exponential moving average and a 10-day exponential smoothed average for the accumulation/distribution line is calculated.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe interpretation of the Chaikin Oscillator is similar to the principle of the accumulation/distribution. All an oscillator does is show the changes in liquidity for the instrument.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nChaikinOscillator(int fast, int slow)\nChaikinOscillator(IDataSeries input, int fast, int slow)\nChaikinOscillator(int fast, int slow)[int barsAgo]\nChaikinOscillator(IDataSeries input, int fast, int slow)[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nChaikinOscillator\n(3, 10)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be outputted for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nfast Number of bars included in the calculation for the fast EMA\n\n\nslow Number of bars included in the calculation for the slow EMA\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output for the oscillator for the fast and slow values of 3 and 10\nPrint(\nThe Chaikin Oscillator value is: \n + ChaikinOscillator(3, 10)[0]);\n\n\n\n\nChaikinVolatility (CVL)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Chaikin Volatility Indicator is one of a few indicators that are designed to try and measure price movement fluctuations. Chaikin takes the daily price range (daily high minus daily low) as the fundamental measure of volatility. With this indicator, a widening range is, by implication, associated with a higher volatility.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe indicator oscillates around the zero line and fluctuates between a scale of +100 to -100. It can be used on a daily chart as well as on a weekly or monthly chart. All values above the zero line represent rising volatility, and the gradient of the rise implies the seriousness of potential floors forming. The Chaikin Volatility is not specifically used to define exact signals, but is considered as more of an assisting tool in the trading system.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nChaikinVolatility(int fast, int slow)\nChaikinVolatility(IDataSeries input, int fast, int slow)\nChaikinVolatility(int fast, int slow)[int barsAgo]\nChaikinVolatility(IDataSeries input, int fast, int slow)[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nChaikinVolatility\n(14)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be outputted for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Chaikin output for a period of 14\nPrint(\nThe value of the Chaikin Volatility is: \n + ChaikinVolatility(14)[0]);\n\n\n\n\nChande Momentum Oscillator (CMO)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe CMO is one of several indicators created by the technical analyst Tushar Chande; it is a technical momentum indicator. This indicator arises from calculating the difference between the total of all recent gains and the total of all recent losses, and then dividing this result by the total of all price movement over the given period. This oscillator shares similarities with other momentum indicators such as the Relative Strength Index and the Stochastic Oscillator, because it is also range-bound (+100 and -100).\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe security is deemed overbought when the momentum oscillator is above +50 and oversold when it is below -50. Many technical traders add a nine-period moving average to this oscillator to act as a signal line. Bullish signals are generated when the oscillator crosses above the signal, and bearish signals are generated when the oscillator crosses down through the signal.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nhttp://www.boersenwissen.de/content/content_bin/cont_bin18.html\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nCMO(int period)\nCMO(IDataSeries input, int period)\nCMO(int period)[int barsAgo]\nCMO(IDataSeries input, int period)[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nCMO\n(14)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output for the value of the Chande Momentum Oscillator\nPrint(\nThe current value for the Chande Momentum Oscillator is: \n + CMO(14)[0]);\n\n\n\n\nClimactic Distance\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Climactic Distance indicator was invented and developed by Gilbert Kreuzthaler, CEO of Include IT GmbH and founder of AgenaTrader.com. This indicator is used in the Location Point Trading system. It calculates the median course of the current and historical candle at a distance to the simple moving average (SMA) of the last 20 periods. Additionally, it also measures the average course deviation within the last 80 periods. If the median course exceeds the top or bottom course deviation, the market is deemed climactic, and this influences the trading decisions made in Location Point Trading.\n\n\nCalcualtion\n\n\nBlack line in the middle: SMA 20\nGreen moving line: Median Kurs\nRed upper and lower line: Average course deviation oft he last 80 periods.\n\n\nMore information\n\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Location-Point-Trading-344217482287592/?fref=ts\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nClimacticDistance(int sMAPeriod, int thresholdPercent)\nClimacticDistance(IDataSeries InSeries, int sMAPeriod, int thresholdPercent)\nClimacticDistance(int period, int tresholdPercent, Color climacticColor)\nClimacticDistance(IDataSeries InSeries, int sMAPeriod, int thresholdPercent, Color climacticColor)\n//Upper band\nClimacticDistance(int sMAPeriod, int thresholdPercent).Upper[int barsAgo]\nClimacticDistance(IDataSeries InSeries, int sMAPeriod, int thresholdPercent).Upper[int barsAgo]\nClimacticDistance(int period, int tresholdPercent, Color climacticColor).Upper[int barsAgo]\nClimacticDistance(IDataSeries InSeries, int sMAPeriod, int thresholdPercent, Color climacticColor).Upper[int barsAgo]\n//Lower band\nClimacticDistance(int sMAPeriod, int thresholdPercent).Lower[int barsAgo]\nClimacticDistance(IDataSeries InSeries, int sMAPeriod, int thresholdPercent).Lower[int barsAgo]\nClimacticDistance(int period, int tresholdPercent, Color climacticColor).Lower[int barsAgo]\nClimacticDistance(IDataSeries InSeries, int sMAPeriod, int thresholdPercent, Color climacticColor).Lower[int barsAgo]\n\n//MovingAverage\nClimacticDistance(int sMAPeriod, int thresholdPercent).MovingAverage[int barsAgo]\nClimacticDistance(IDataSeries InSeries, int sMAPeriod, int thresholdPercent).MovingAverage[int barsAgo]\nClimacticDistance(int period, int tresholdPercent, Color climacticColor).MovingAverage[int barsAgo]\nClimacticDistance(IDataSeries InSeries, int sMAPeriod, int thresholdPercent, Color climacticColor).MovingAverage[int barsAgo]\n//Distance\nClimacticDistance(int sMAPeriod, int thresholdPercent).Distance[int barsAgo]\nClimacticDistance(IDataSeries InSeries, int sMAPeriod, int thresholdPercent).Distance[int barsAgo]\nClimacticDistance(int period, int tresholdPercent, Color climacticColor).Distance[int barsAgo]\nClimacticDistance(IDataSeries InSeries, int sMAPeriod, int thresholdPercent, Color climacticColor).Distance[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nParameters\n\n\nInt\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\nImage\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output of the value for the Upper climactic distance line\nPrint(\u201cValue of the upper band: \u201c + ClimacticDistnance(20, 80).Upper[0]);\n//Output of the value for the Lower climactic distance line\nPrint(\u201cValue of the upper band: \u201c + ClimacticDistnance(20, 80).Lower[0]);\n//Output of the value for the Distance climactic distance line\nPrint(\u201cValue of the upper band: \u201c + ClimacticDistnance(20, 80).Distance[0]);\n//Output of the value for the Moving Average climactic distance line\nPrint(\u201cValue of the upper band: \u201c + ClimacticDistnance(20, 80).MovingAverage[0]);\n\n\n\n\nCommodity Channel Index (CCI)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Commodity Channel Index (CCI), which was created by Donald Lambert and actually featured in Commodities magazine in 1980, is a versatile indicator that can be used for identifying a new trend or as a warning of extreme conditions. Lambert originally developed the CCI as a means to identify cyclical turns in commodities \u2013 however, the indicator can also successfully be applied to ETFs, indices, stocks and various other securities. In general, what CCI does is to measure the current price level relative to an average price level over a specified period of time. When prices are well above their average, CCI is relatively high. When prices are far below their average, CCI is relatively low. This is how CCI can be used for identifying overbought and oversold levels.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nCCI measures the difference between a securitys price change and its average price change. High positive readings indicate that prices are well above their average, which is a show of strength. Low negative readings indicate that prices are well below their average, which is a show of weakness.\n\n\nThe Commodity Channel Index (CCI) can be used as either a coincident or leading indicator. As a coincident indicator, surges above +100 reflect strong price action that can signal the start of an uptrend. Plunges below -100 reflect weak price action that can signal the start of a downtrend.\n\n\nAs a\u00a0\nleading indicator\n, \nmomentum oscillators\n, chartists can look for overbought or oversold conditions that may foreshadow a mean reversion. Similarly, bullish and bearish divergences can be used to detect early momentum shifts and anticipate trend reversals.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nVTAD: \nhttp://vtadwiki.vtad.de/index.php/Commodity_Channel_Index\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nCCI(int period)\nCCI(IDataSeries input, int period)\nCCI(int period)[int barsAgo]\nCCI(IDataSeries input, int period)[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nCCI\n(14)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output for the CCI value calculated using 14 periods\nPrint(\nThe value of the Commodity Channel Index is: \n + CCI(14));\n\n\n\n\nDarvas Boxes\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nFormer ballroom dancer Nicolas Darvas developed the Darvas boxes as a trading strategy in 1956. Darvas' trading technique consisted of buying into stocks that were trading at new 52-week highs, with accordingly high volumes. When a stock price rises above the previous 52-week high, but then proceeds to fall back to a price not far from that high, a Darvas box is formed. If the price falls too far, this can signify a false breakout. Otherwise, however, the lower price is used as the bottom of the box and the higher price as the top.\nA box is made up of an upper boundary (top) and a lower boundary (floor). Each new box is created based on a previous box, depicting a \u201cstair\u201d formation.\nIf a new high is not formed after three consecutive days, then the high is labeled as the upper boundary. Following this, the floor is specified based on the lowest price.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThis system is similar to a trend-following channel breakout system.

If a short position is open simultaneously, it is closed. This works vice versa with shorts. The  Donchian channel trading system is a purely trend-following system based on the concept \u201cbuy when it is strong, sell when it is weak\u201d. The famous \u201cTurtles\u201d also employed this breakout system. This indicator displays the highs and lows of the last n days as lines above and below the price development. 20 days represent 4 weeks.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nVTAD: \nhttp://vtadwiki.vtad.de/index.php/Donchian_Channel\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nDonchianChannel(int period)\nDonchianChannel(IDataSeries input, int period)\n\n//Upper band\nDonchianChannel(int period).Upper[int barsAgo]\nDonchianChannel(IDataSeries input, int period).Upper[int barsAgo]\n\n//Middle band\nDonchianChannel(int period)[int barsAgo]\nDonchianChannel(IDataSeries input, int period)[int barsAgo]\n\n//Lower band\nDonchianChannel(int period).Lower[int barsAgo]\nDonchianChannel(IDataSeries input, int period).Lower[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nDonchianChannel\n(14)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output for the values of the Donchian Channel\nPrint(\nThe upper band is at: \n + DonchianChannel(14).Upper[0]);\nPrint(\nThe middle band is at: \n + DonchianChannel(14)[0]);\nPrint(\nThe lower band is at: \n + DonchianChannel(14).Lower[0]);\n\n\n\n\nDirectional Movement Index (DMI)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nWelles Wilder Jr. developed the Directional Movement concept in 1978. His concept includes the following components:\n\n\nDirectional Movement Index (DMI)\n\n\nAverage Directional Movement Index (\nADX\n)\n\n\nTrue Range (TR)\n\n\nThe Directional Movement Index comes before the Average Directional Movement Index. The DMI shows the strengths of the trend-favoring price movements in percentages. Its standard application is the smoothed ADX.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe DMI shows the strength of the trend, but not the trend direction. This means that it is particularly suited as a filter for trading systems employing the Parabolic SAR, for example, in order to filter out sideways phases. When the DMI rises (especially above 25), a trend is displayed; anything below that is recognized as a sideways phase. The +DI and the \u2013DI point towards a trend. An uptrend is classified when the +DI is above the \u2013DI. The further apart they drift, the stronger the trend.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nVTAD: \nhttp://vtadwiki.vtad.de/index.php/DMI_-_Directional_Movement_Index\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nDMI(int period)\nDMI(IDataSeries input, int period)\nDMI(int period)[int barsAgo]\nDMI(IDataSeries input, int period)[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nDMI\n(20)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output for the DMI\nPrint(\nThe current DMI value is: \n + DMI(20)[0]);\n\n\n\n\nDouble Stochastics (DSS)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nWilliam Blau was the developer of the Double Smoothed Stochastic (DSS), which is a double-smoothed stochastic indicator. After a while, it was improved upon by Walter Bressert as a variation of the double-smoothed stochastic. Smaller changes in the price movements cause this indicator to react more sensitively, and it also produces more signals than the one Blau developed. The Bressert version therefore also illustrates extreme zones more clearly than the Blau version.\n\n\nRegardless of the various calculation methods used, the DSS always stays within a scale of 0 to 100. The extreme zones in the developed stochastics are the same as for the original stochastics. The upper extreme area is marked at 80, and the lower extreme zone at 20 - these values cannot be changed. For many applications, it is wise to include an additional middle line at 50, and to adapt this to the circumstances as needed.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nValues above 80 are seen as overbought, and below 20 as oversold. In addition, signals are produced by the signal line\u2019s behavior and movements into and out of the extreme zones.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nDoubleStochastics(int period)\nDoubleStochastics(int period)[int barsAgo]\nDoubleStochastics(int period, DoubleStochasticsMode mode, int EMA-Period1)\nDoubleStochastics(IDataSeries input, int period, DoubleStochasticsMode mode, int EMA-Period1)\nDoubleStochastics(int period, DoubleStochasticsMode mode, int EMA-Period1)[int barsAgo]\nDoubleStochastics(IDataSeries input, int period, DoubleStochasticsMode mode, int EMA-Period1)[int barsAgo]\nDoubleStochastics(int period, DoubleStochasticsMode mode, int EMA-Period1, int EMA-Period2)\nDoubleStochastics(IDataSeries input, int period, DoubleStochasticsMode mode, int EMA-Period1, int EMA-Period2)\nDoubleStochastics(int period, DoubleStochasticsMode mode, int EMA-Period1, int EMA-Period2)[int barsAgo]\nDoubleStochastics(IDataSeries input, int period, DoubleStochasticsMode mode, int EMA-Period1, int EMA-Period2)[int barsAgo]\n\n//For the value of %K\nDoubleStochastics(int period).K[int barsAgo]\nDoubleStochastics(IDataSeries input, int period).K[int barsAgo]\nDoubleStochastics(int period, DoubleStochasticsMode mode, int EMA-Period1).K[int barsAgo]\nDoubleStochastics(IDataSeries input, int period, DoubleStochasticsMode mode, int EMA-Period1).K[int barsAgo]\nDoubleStochastics(int period, DoubleStochasticsMode mode, int EMA-Period1, int EMA-Period2).K[int barsAgo]\nDoubleStochastics(IDataSeries input, int period, DoubleStochasticsMode mode, int EMA-Period1, int EMA-Period2).K[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nDoubleStochastics\n(...)[\nint\n barsAgo] or \nDoubleStochastics\n(...).K[\nint\n barsAgo]), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations (default: 10)\n\n\nmode Method of calculation, possible inputs are Blau, Blau2, Bressert\n\n\nEMA-Period1 Periods for the EMA\n\n\nEMA-Period2 Periods for the second EMA\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output for %K\nPrint(\nThe value of the DSS Bressert %K is: \n + DoubleStochastics(10, DoubleStochasticsMode.Bressert, 2)[0]);\n\n\n\n\nDynamic Momentum Index (DMIndex)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Dynamic Momentum Index, which was developed by Tushar Chande, is a specific variant of the Relative Strength Index. Chande changed the Dynamic Momentum Index in such a way that, based on various factors, the period settings automatically adjust themselves, which he achieved by coupling it to the RSI in order for a volatility component to be present. The definition of this volatility component is based on a 5-day standard deviation of the closing prices. This, in turn, is then compared to the 10-day average of a 5-day standard deviation.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nIf the DMI is inside the oversold zone, it is reasonable to assume that prices are going to start to fall.\n\n\nFurther and more concise information\n\n\nVTAD: \nhttp://vtadwiki.vtad.de/index.php/Dynamic_Momentum_Index\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nDMIndex(int smooth)\nDMIndex(IDataSeries input, int smooth)\nDMIndex(int smooth)[int barsAgo]\nDMIndex(IDataSeries input, int smooth)[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nDMIndex\n(3)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nsmooth Smoothing settings\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output of the value for the DMIndex Indicator with a smoothing factor of 3\nPrint(\nThe current value for the DMIndex is: \n + DMIndex(3)[0]);\n\n\n\n\nEase of Movement (EOM)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nEase of Movement (EMV) is a volume-based oscillator created by Richard Arms that constantly moves above and below the zero line. It is intended to measure the \"ease\" of price movement, as suggested by the name. Arms developed Equivolume charts in order to visually display price ranges and volume. Ease of Movement expands upon Equivolume by quantifying the price/volume relationship and displaying the results in the form of an oscillator. Generally, when the oscillator is in a positive area, prices are advancing with relative ease. On the other hand, when the oscillator is in negative territory, prices are falling with relative ease.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nWhen the EOM is moving away from the zero line (marker) then an impulse has begun in that direction. During a breakout onto the opposite side of the zero line, it is recommended to enter with the trend direction.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nhttp://www.volumen-analyse.de\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nEaseOfMovement(int smoothing, int volDivisor)\nEaseOfMovement(IDataSeries input, int smoothing, int volDivisor)\nEaseOfMovement(int smoothing, int volDivisor)[int barsAgo]\nEaseOfMovement(IDataSeries input, int smoothing, int volDivisor)[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nEaseOfMovement\n(14, 10000)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nsmoothing Smoothing settings\n\n\nvolDivisor For calculation of the box ratio (see \u201cCalculation\u201d below)\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nCalculation\n\n\nMidpoint = (High + Low) / 2\nMidpointMove = Midpoint [today] \u2013 Midpoint [yesterday]\nBoxRatio = Volume / (High \u2013 Low)\nEase = MidpointMove / Box Ratio\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output for the values of the EOM line\nPrint(\nThe value for the Ease of Movement is: \n + EaseOfMovement(14, 10000)[0]);\n\n\n\n\nFisher Transform\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe physicist John Ehlers created the Fisher Transform in 2002. The intention of the indicator is to show where there are turning points, which can be achieved with the help of the Inverse Fisher Transform. This changes indicators in such a way that the movements are less random, and the signal quality is clearer. The Fisher Transform either stretches or compresses the input values of the function so that the output is very likely to be between -1 and 1. This gives us a clearly identifiable pattern where even indicators such as the RSI become better defined and more precise.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nA system using the Fisher Transform can be found here:\n\nhttps://www.prorealtime.com/de/pdf/probacktest.pdf\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nFisherTransform\n(10)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nFisherTransform(int period)\nFisherTransform(IDataSeries input, int period)\nFisherTransform(int period)[int barsAgo]\nFisherTransform(IDataSeries input, int period)[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output values for the Fisher Transform\nPrint(\nThe current value for the Fisher Transform is: \n + FisherTransform(10)[0]);\n\n\n\n\nForecast Oscillator (FOSC)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe FOSC makes a comparison of the current price against the value returned by the Time Series Forecast study. It is calculated as a percentage ratio of the difference between the close price and the Time Series Forecast value for the previous bar.\n\n\nWhen this oscillator displays positive values, it hints that the Time Series Forecast has underestimated the price, whereas negative values suggest that the TSF has overestimated the price. Usually, an SMA also accompanies the Forecast Oscillator line in the search for oscillator reversals.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nFMLabs: \nhttp://www.fmlabs.com/reference/default.htm?url=ForecastOscillator.htm\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nFOSC\n(14)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nFOSC(int period)\nFOSC(IDataSeries input, int period)\nFOSC(int period)[int barsAgo]\nFOSC(IDataSeries input, int period)[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n//Output for the Forecast Oscillator\nPrint(\nThe current value for the Forecast Oscillator is: \n + FOSC(14)[0]);\n\n//Determining the future market direction\nif (FOSC(14)[0] \n 0)\nPrint(\nThe FOSC is bigger than zero, which indicates rising price movements.\n);\n\n\n\n\nHighestHighIndex()\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Highest High Index prints the index for the bars with the highest high within a specified number of periods.

Ichimoku Kinko Hyo literally means \"one look equilibrium chart\". With just one look, traders can identify the trend and search for possible signals in that trend. The indicator was developed by the journalist Goichi Hosoda, and published in his 1969 book. Although the Ichimoku Cloud may appear complicated when looked at on the price chart, it is in fact a simple indicator that can be implemented very well \u2013 a tribute to the fact that its inventor was a journalist!

Furthermore, there are several data series used in stop calculations for self-developed indicators and strategies.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nInside bars are bars whose body (open-close) are located within the high-low span of the previous bar. The previous bar is generally called an outside bar.\nInside bars will sometimes reflect sideways phases, and will also display trend corrections of lower timeframes. When trading inside bars, the stop is placed at the high or low of the previous period. If the high or low of the previous candle is unsuitable, then the high or low of an older candle is used.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nInsideBarsMT().isInsideBar[int barsAgo]\nInsideBarsMT().isOutsideBar[int barsAgo]\nInsideBarsMT().HighBeforeOutsideBar[int barsAgo]\nInsideBarsMT().LowBeforeOutsideBar[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nSettings\n\n\n\n\nInsideBarsMT\n().isInsideBar[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nWill return \u201ctrue\u201d if the referenced bar is an inside bar, otherwise \u201cfalse\u201d\n\n\n\n\nInsideBarsMT\n().isOutsideBar[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nWill return \u201ctrue\u201d if the previous bar is an outside bar\n\n\n\n\nInsideBarsMT\n().HighBeforeOutsideBar[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nWill output the high of the bar preceding the outside bar\n\n\n\n\nInsideBarsMT\n().LowBeforeOutsideBar[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nWill return the low of the bar preceding the outside bar\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nTolerance parameter\n\n\nIn the image below you will see a longer \u201cphase\u201d where the market is within an inside bar. The bar marked with the arrow opens the low of the outside bar.

This indicator shares similarities with Bollinger Bands, where the bands are set using the standard deviation. Here, instead of using the standard deviation, Keltner Channels use the Average True Range (ATR) to set the channel distance. Typically, the channels are set two Average True Range values above and two ATRs below the 20-day EMA. The EMA determines the direction and the Average True Range dictates the channel width. Keltner Channels form a trend-following indicator that is applied with the aim of identifying reversals with channel breakouts and channel direction. The channels can also be used to spot overbought and oversold levels when the trend is flat.\nIn his 1960 book, \nHow to Make Money in Commodities,\n Chester Keltner featured the \"Ten-Day Moving Average Trading Rule,\" credited as the original version of Keltner Channels. This version started off with a 10-day SMA of the typical price {(H+L+C)/3)} as the center line. The 10-day SMA of the high-low range was added and subtracted to set the upper and lower channel lines respectively. Linda Bradford Raschke then brought in the more recent version of Keltner Channels in the 1980s. Similarly to Bollinger Bands, this new version made use of a volatility-based indicator, Average True Range (ATR), to set channel width.\nMiddle line = 20-day exponential moving average\nUpper channel line: 20-day EMA + (2x ATR(10))\nLower channel line: 20-day EMA \u2013 (2xATR(10))\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nIndicators based on channels, bands and envelopes are designed to encompass most price action. Therefore, moves above or below the channel lines warrant attention because they are relatively rare. Trends often start with strong moves in one direction or another. A surge above the upper channel line shows extraordinary strength, while a plunge below the lower channel line shows extraordinary weakness. Such strong moves can signal the end of one trend and the beginning of another.\n\n\nWith an exponential\u00a0\nmoving average\n, \naverage\n\u00a0as their foundation, the Keltner Channels are a trend-following indicator. As with moving averages and trend-following indicators, Keltner Channels lag price action. The direction of the moving average dictates the direction of the channel. In general, a downtrend is present when the channel moves lower, while an uptrend exists when the channel moves higher. The trend is flat when the channel moves sideways.\n\n\nA channel upturn and break above the upper trend line can signal the start of an uptrend. A channel downturn and break below the lower trend line can signal the start a downtrend. Sometimes a strong trend does not take hold after a channel breakout and prices oscillate between the channel lines. Such trading ranges are marked by a relatively flat moving average. The channel boundaries can then be used to identify overbought and oversold levels for trading purposes.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nVTAD:

is a technical indicator that was developed by Stephen Klinger in order to determine long-term trends of the money flow. At the same time, the indicator is sensitive enough to also identify short-term fluctuations, thereby giving the trader the possibility to detect even short-term reversals in the market. The indicator compares the influent and effluent volume of an instrument with its price movements, and is outputted as an oscillator. A signal line (13-period moving average) is used for generating signals. Divergences in the KlingerVolumeOscillator in comparison to the price movement can also be used for entry and exit decisions. A bullish signal is formed when the KlingerVolumeOscillator start to rise while the price continues to fall; the opposite goes for a bearish signal.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\nto be announced\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\nto be announced\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nto be announced\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nto be announced\n\n\nLinear Regression\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nLinear Regression is used to determine trends. Here, the prices are set as dependent variables, and time is set as an independent variable. Using the method for determination of the smallest square, a straight line is placed through the price movements in such a way that the distance between the prices and the line deviates as little as possible. Using this method also establishes a trend between two points in time. The regression line can be found in the middle of the price channel, and the indicator provides the end values of multiple linear regression trend lines. Each point along this indicator is therefore an end value of a linear regression trend line. What results is quite similar to a smoothing average, with the difference that the regression line exhibits less lag.\n\n\nSee \nR-Squared\n, \nLinRegSlope\n, \nLinRegIntercept\n.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nhttp://www.vtad.de/sites/files/forschung/vtad_Award_2011_Joachim_Lenz_Veroeffentlichung.pdf\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe linear regression indicator is used as a prognosis tool for the future developments of the instrument. If the prices are rising or falling steadily, then it can be expected that they will return to a more realistic/reasonable level. In other words: the indicator shows where the price should be, a deviation from the regression is assumed to be short-lived and to be corrected soon.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nLinReg(int period)\nLinReg(IDataSeries input, int period)\nLinReg(int period)[int barsAgo]\nLinReg(IDataSeries input, int period)[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nLinReg\n(14)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Show the current values of the regression line\nPrint(\nThe current value for the linear regression is: \n + LinReg(14)[0]);\n\n\n\n\nLinRegIntercept\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Linear Regression Intercept outputs the value of the regression constant, i.e. the mathematical intersection of where the regression line meets the price axis.\n\n\nA straight line can be accurately determined with the help of the slope and intercept values.\n\n\nSee \nLinear Regression\n, \nR-Squared\n \nLinRegSlope\n.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe indicator is not used by itself, but is simply a component of trading systems that analyze trade trends with the help of the linear regression.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nLinRegIntercept(int period)\nLinRegIntercept(IDataSeries input, int period)\nLinRegIntercept(int period)[int barsAgo]\nLinRegIntercept(IDataSeries input, int period)[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nLinRegIntercept\n(14)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Show current value\nPrint(\nThe current value of the regression constant is: \n + LinRegIntercept(14)[0]);\n\n\n\n\nLinRegSlope\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Linear Regression Slope outputs the slope of the linear regression line, and is a measurement of the regression line\u2019s \u201celevation\u201d.\n\n\nSee \nLinear Regression\n, \nR-Squared\n, \nLinRegIntercept\n.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nSimply put: in an uptrend, the elevation is positive and facing upwards.

The MACD makes two trend-following indicators, moving averages, average, become a momentum oscillator by subtracting the longer moving average from the shorter moving average. As a result of this, the MACD offers great advantages: trend following and momentum. The MACD moves above and below the zero line as the moving averages converge, cross and diverge again. Signal line crossovers, centerline crossovers and divergences are things that traders can keep an eye out for to generate signals. Since the MACD is unbounded, it is not especially useful for identifying overbought or oversold levels. The MACD line is the 12-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) minus the 26-day EMA, and closing prices are used for these moving averages. A 9-day EMA of the MACD line is plotted with the indicator acting as a signal line and identifying turns. The MACD histogram shows the difference between the MACD and its 9-day EMA, i.e. the signal line. When the MACD line is above its signal line, the histogram is positive, and vice versa when the MACD line is below its signal line.\n\n\nThe typical settings used with the MACD are the values 12, 26 and 9. However, other values can also be used depending on the trading style and goals in mind.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nAs its name implies, the MACD is all about the convergence and divergence of the two moving averages. Convergence occurs when the moving averages move towards each other. Divergence occurs when the moving averages move away from each other. The shorter moving average (12-day) is faster and responsible for most MACD movements. The longer moving average (26-day) is slower and less reactive to price changes in the underlying security.\n\n\nThe MACD line oscillates above and below the zero line, which is also known as the centerline. These crossovers signal that the 12-day EMA has crossed the 26-day EMA. The direction, of course, depends on the direction of the moving average cross. Positive MACD indicates that the 12-day EMA is above the 26-day EMA. Positive values increase as the shorter EMA diverges further from the longer EMA.\u00a0This means upside momentum is increasing.\u00a0Negative MACD values indicate that the 12-day EMA is below the 26-day EMA. Negative values increase as the shorter EMA diverges further below the longer EMA.\u00a0This means downside\u00a0\nmomentum\n\u00a0is increasing. Signal line crossovers are the most common MACD signals. The signal line is a 9-day EMA of the MACD line. As a moving average of the indicator, it trails the MACD and makes it easier to spot MACD turns. A bullish crossover occurs when the MACD turns up and crosses above the signal line. A bearish crossover occurs when the MACD turns down and crosses below the signal line. Crossovers can last a few days or a few weeks, it all depends on the strength of the move.\n\n\nDue diligence is required before relying on these common signals. Signal line crossovers at positive or negative extremes should be viewed with caution. Even though the MACD does not have upper and lower limits, chartists can estimate historical extremes with a simple visual assessment. It takes a strong move in the underlying security to push momentum to an extreme. Even though the move may continue, momentum is likely to slow and this will usually produce a signal line crossover at the extremities. Volatility in the underlying security can also increase the number of crossovers.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nVTAD: \nhttp://vtadwiki.vtad.de/index.php/MACD\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nMACD(int fast, int slow, int smooth)\nMACD(IDataSeries input, int fast, int slow, int smooth)\n\n//For the value of the MACD line\nMACD(int fast, int slow, int smooth)[int barsAgo]\nMACD(IDataSeries input, int fast, int slow, int smooth)[int barsAgo]\n\n//For the value of the signal line\nMACD(int fast, int slow, int smooth).Avg[int barsAgo]\nMACD(IDataSeries input, int fast, int slow, int smooth).Avg[int barsAgo]\n\n//For the difference between the MACD and the signal line\nMACD(int fast, int slow, int smooth).Diff[int barsAgo]\nMACD(IDataSeries input, int fast, int slow, int smooth).Diff[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nMACD\n(12,26,9)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nfast Number of periods for the fast EMA calculation\n\n\nslow Number of periods for the slow EMA calculation\n\n\nsmooth Number of periods for the EMA calculation of the signal line\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Show the current values for the MACD\nPrint(\nThe current value for the MACD line is: \n + MACD(12,26,9)[0]);\nPrint(\nThe current value for the signal line is: \n + MACD(12,26,9).Avg[0]);\nPrint(\nThe difference between the MACD and the signal line is: \n + MACD(12,26,9).Diff[0]);\n\n\n\n\nMAEnvelopes\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThese Moving Average Envelopes are percentage-based envelopes placed above and below a moving average. The moving average forms the base for this indicator, and can be a either simple or exponential moving average. Each MA envelope is set the same percentage above or below the moving average, thereby creating parallel bands that follow price action. Moving Average Envelopes can be used as a trend-following indicator with a moving average as the base. But this indicator is not limited to just trend following: the envelopes can also be used for spotting overbought and oversold levels when the trend is relatively flat.\n\n\nIndicators based on channels, bands and envelopes are intended to encompass most price action, which is why moves above or below the envelopes deserve attention. Trends often start with sharp moves in one direction \u2013 a surge above the upper envelope shows extraordinary strength, while a dive below the lower envelope exhibits extraordinary weakness. Strong moves such as these can signal the end of one trend and the start of another.\n\n\nWith a \nmoving average\n as the foundation, Moving Average Envelopes are a trend-following indicator. As with moving averages, the envelopes lag price action. The direction of the moving average dictates the direction of the channel, so generally, when the channel moves lower, a downtrend exists, and when the channel goes higher, an uptrend is present. When the channel moves sideways, this signifies that the trend is flat.\n\n\nOccasionally, it happens that a strong trend does not establish itself after an envelope break, and prices move into a trading range. Trading ranges such as these are characterized by a relatively flat moving average. These envelopes can then be used to spot overbought and oversold levels. A move above the upper envelope shows an overbought situation; a move below the lower envelope signals an oversold situation.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nMAEnvelopes(double envelopePercentage, MAEnvelopesMAType maType, int period)\nMAEnvelopes(IDataSeries input, double envelopePercentage, MAEnvelopesMAType maType, int period)\n\n//For the upper band\nMAEnvelopes(double envelopePercentage, MAEnvelopesMAType maType, int period).Upper[int barsAgo]\nMAEnvelopes(IDataSeries input, double envelopePercentage, MAEnvelopesMAType maType, int period).Upper[int barsAgo]\n\n//For the middle band\nMAEnvelopes(double envelopePercentage, MAEnvelopesMAType maType, int period).Middle[int barsAgo]\nMAEnvelopes(IDataSeries input, double envelopePercentage, MAEnvelopesMAType maType, int period).Middle[int barsAgo]\n\n//For the lower band\nMAEnvelopes(double envelopePercentage, MAEnvelopesMAType maType, int period).Lower[int barsAgo]\nMAEnvelopes(IDataSeries input, double envelopePercentage, MAEnvelopesMAType maType, int period).Lower[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nMAEnvelopes\n(14,SMA,1.5)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nenvelopePercentage Distance of the upper and lower bands from the middle line in percent\n\n\nmaType Type of moving average used, possible choices are:\n-   EMA\n-   HMA\n-   SMA (default)\n-   TMA\n-   TEMA\n-   WMA\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\n//Value output for the upper band\nPrint(\nUpper band of the MA Envelope: \n + MAEnvelopes(1.5, MAEnvelopesMAType.SMA, 14).Upper[0]);\n\n//Value output for the middle band\nPrint(\nMiddle band of the MA Envelope: \n + MAEnvelopes(1.5, MAEnvelopesMAType.SMA, 14).Middle[0]);\n\n//Value output for the lower band\nPrint(\nLower band of the MA Envelope: \n + MAEnvelopes(1.5, MAEnvelopesMAType.SMA, 14).Lower[0]);\n\n\n\n\nMarketPhases\n\n\nThe installation of the Technical Analysis Package is required in order to access this indicator.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Market Phases Indicator is another important component of the Technical Analysis Package, and is based on integrated trend detection for the various relevant trading market phases.\n\n\nThe market phases are defined according to the book series \u201cDer H\u00e4ndler\u201d (\u201cThe Trader\u201d) by Michael Voigt.\n\n\nPhase 3:\n\n\nThe market is located far away from the movement; a correction is imminent.\n\n\n\n\nPhase 4:\n\n\nThe market is in correction mode.

This relatively simple indicator is so popular because it measures the attenuation of the motion without the need for complex formulas. The momentum indicator represents a whole family of indicators that measure a movement\u2019s strength. Other representatives in this case are the RSI or CCI, and so on. In the illustration below, the indicator is a graph that oscillates around a zero point. There is no fixed scale in percentage terms, and the value can be quite far removed from the zero point; this usually happens when the price makes an exceptionally strong leap, which is why the indicator predominantly shows the direction in which the current prices are moving towards.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nEntry signals are generated when the indicator crosses the zero line.\n\n\nSee \nROC\n.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nhttp://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum_%28Chartanalyse%29\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nMomentum(int period)\nMomentum (IDataSeries input, int period)\nMomentum (int period)[int barsAgo]\nMomentum (IDataSeries input, int period)[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nMomentum\n(14)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output of the values for the momentum indicator.\nPrint(\nThe current value for the momentum is \n + Momentum(14)[0]);\n\n\n\n\nMoney Flow Index (MFI)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe MFI is an oscillator that makes use of both volume and price to measure buying and selling pressure. MFI, which was developed by Gene Quong and Avrum Soudack, is also known as volume-weighted \nRSI\n. MFI starts with the typical price for each period. Money flow is then positive when this aforementioned typical price increases (buying pressure) and negative when it decreases (selling pressure). A ratio of positive-negative money flow is then inserted into an RSI formula to come up with an oscillator that fluctuates between 0 and 100. The MFI, which is a momentum oscillator linked to volume, is best used for identifying reversals and price extremes with a variety of different signals.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe MFI is interpreted similarly to the RSI indicator. The MFI\u2019s decisive factor is much stronger than the RSI\u2019s when it comes to trend direction, due to the fact that volume is included in the calculation.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nVTAD: \nhttp://vtadwiki.vtad.de/index.php/Money_Flow_Index\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nMFI(int period)\nMFI(IDataSeries input, int period)\nMFI(int period)[int barsAgo]\nMFI(IDataSeries input, int period)[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nMFI\n(14)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Current MFI value\nPrint(\nThe current value for the MFI is: \n + MFI(14)[0]);\n\n\n\n\nMoving Averages\n\n\nVariants\n\n\nDEMA\n - Double Exponential Moving Average\n\n\nEMA\n - Exponential Moving Average\n\n\nHMA\n - Hull Moving Average\n\n\nKAMA\n - Kaufman's Adaptive Moving Average\n\n\nMAMA\n - Mesa Adaptive Moving Average\n\n\nSMA\n - Simple Moving Average\n\n\nTEMA\n - Triple Exponential Moving Average\n\n\nTMA\n - Triangular Moving Average\n\n\nTRIX\n - Triple Exponential Moving Average\n\n\nT3\n - Triple Exponential Moving Average\n\n\nVMA\n - Variable Moving Average\n\n\nVWMA\n - Volume Weighted Moving Average\n\n\nWMA\n, \nVMA\n - Weighted Moving Average\n\n\nZLEMA\n - Zero Lag Exponential Moving Average\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe arithmetic average, also known as the moving average or simple moving average, smoothes the progression of the price for better trend detection. Moving averages are trend-following indicators; they follow the course and do not lead. IsSerieRising averages show uptrends, whereas falling averages display downtrends.\nBy varying the period input, the time delay of the average can be changed. The smaller the period interval, the quicker the reaction time will be, but as a consequence, the smoothing effect will also be diminished. The opposite is true when increasing the period selection. The most popular choices are: 38, 50, 100 and 200 days. The 200-day moving average in particular has a significant importance for institutional traders, since it displays the long-term trend. 200 trading days are equal to a trading year. When the 200 MA is broken, then buy/sell signals are generated.\n\n\nApplications\n\n\nCrossing of two averages\n\n\nThe integration of multiple moving averages is used to identify trend sequences and minimize the number of false signals. When two arithmetic averages are used, whereby one is a short-term and the other a long-term, more interesting signals can be generated. One such application can be seen with Richard Donchian\u2019s methodologies, such as using the 5 and 20-day averages.\nThe Double Crossover Method generates signals in the following way:\n\n\nIf the short-term average crosses the long-term average from below, this is called a Golden Cross, and a buy signal is generated. Higher trading volume reinforces the quality of the signal. The long-term average works as a support line in an uptrend.\n\n\nIf the short-term average crosses the long-term average from above, this is called a Death Cross. It generates a sell signal. Higher trading volume reinforces the signal quality. In a downtrend, the long-term average functions as a resistance line.\n\n\nCrossing of three moving averages\n\n\nAnother method is to use three moving averages (Triple Crossover Method). This method was presented by R.C Allen, who used the 4, 9, and 18-day averages and suggested that a trend change is hinted at when the 4MA crosses the 9MA from bottom to top. An entry is only recommended when all lines are above the 18-day period. An exit is initiated when the 4-day MA moves below the 9-day MA.\n(Source: VTAD)\n\n\nDEMA - Double Exponential Moving Average\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Double Exponential Moving Average is a technical indicator created by Patrick Mulloy.

The weighting given to the most recent price depends on the number of periods in the moving average. Calculating an exponential moving average involves three steps. 1. Calculate the simple moving average. An exponential moving average (EMA) must start somewhere, therefore a simple moving average is used as the previous period's EMA in the beginning calculation. 2. Calculate the weighting multiplier. 3. Calculate the EMA.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe EMA is used by many traders in the most varying of timeframes. It is especially meaningful within the 15, 60 and 240-minute charts. The EMA 200 line is also especially popular with traders.\n\n\nIf the price rises sharply and moves away quickly from the respective EMA line, it is possible to enter countertrend positions in order to profit from the potential return to the moving average.\nGeneral interpretations of the moving averages also apply to the EMA.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nEMA(int period)\nEMA(IDataSeries input, int period)\nEMA(int period)[int barsAgo]\nEMA(IDataSeries input, int period)[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nEMA\n(20)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nCalculation\n\n\nValue.Set(ProcessingBarIndex == 0 ?

The calculation is carried out using several weighted moving averages, thereby partially reducing the smoothing effect. Hull\u2019s methodology uses square roots of the period instead of the actual period itself.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe same interpretations as for the moving averages apply to the HMA, the only major distinction being the reduced lag.

This efficiency ratio (the squared efficiency factor) is a measure that can also be used by itself. The trend efficiency is the ratio of the absolute price change from the start to the end of the period, and the total of the absolute daily price changes. At higher trending efficiencies (i.e. straight price movements) without too much variation, the extra price carries a higher weighting, according to a shorter day period setting. Lower trending frequencies carry a smaller weighting.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nKaufman mentions that a rising KAMA value can be interpreted as a buying signal, whilst falling KAMA values assume the prices to be falling.\nKaufman also defines a maximum and minimum value for the calculation of the smoothing components. The efficiency ratio is converted using specified maximum and minimum values, which are applied to newly incoming price changes. Kaufman uses 2 (short period) as a minimum value and 30 (long period) as a maximum value. The number of days for the determination of the efficiency ratio is one of the more important parameters for the KAMA.\n\n\nFor a more general interpretation of moving averages, please see the following chapter: \nMoving Averages\n.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nhttp://www.investor-verlag.de/boersenwissen/kama/\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nKAMA(int fast, int period, int slow)\nKAMA(IDataSeries input, int fast, int period, int slow)\nKAMA(int fast, int period, int slow)[int barsAgo]\nKAMA(IDataSeries input, int fast, int period, int slow)[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nKAMA\n(2,10,30)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nfast Short period\n\n\nslow Long period\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output for the value of the Kaufman Moving Average(KAMA)\nPrint(\nThe current value of the KAMA is \n + KAMA(2,10,30)[0]);\n\n\n\n\nMAMA - Mesa Adaptive Moving Average\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis automatically adapting moving average has a period length that is determined by means of various complex calculations. This complex indicator has its origins in publications by John Ehlers. Ehlers calculates cycles for the price movements to determine the length and intensity of single trend phases. Working with the length of the cycles, the weighting factor for the moving average can be established in several different ways.\n\n\nFAMA\n\nThis indicator is a second line \u2013 the name FAMA can be found in various publications.

In mathematical terms, this is the arithmetic mean of a number of individual lengths. It is called \u201cmoving\u201d because to establish an average, the oldest value is always sacrificed to make space for the new incoming price change. Fundamentally speaking, the period length influences the intensity of the smoothing. Shorter periods (such as 10 days) will mean that the indicator follows the price changes quite closely.\nThe SMA has a few disadvantages, which is why several adaptations of this indicator have been developed in the last few years. One of the biggest disadvantages is the fact that the indicator tends to lag, and the equal weighting for all data inputs across time intervals.\nYou can find more general interpretations and meanings here: \nMoving Averages\n.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nhttp://www.forex-trading-online.de/indikatoren/simple-moving-average-sma\n\n\nhttp://vtadwiki.vtad.de/index.php/SMA#Average-Off-Berechnungsverfahren_.28MMA.29\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nSMA(int period)\nSMA(IDataSeries InSeries, int period)\nSMA(int period)[int barsAgo]\nSMA(IDataSeries InSeries, int period)[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nSMA\n(14)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nCalculation\n\n\nValue.\nSet\n((last + InSeries[0] - InSeries[Period]) / Math.\nMin\n(ProcessingBarIndex, Period));\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output of the SMA value\nPrint(\nThe current SMA value is \n + SMA(14)[0]);\n\n\n\n\nSMA MTF (MultiTimeFrame)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe SMA MTF \u2013 as is true for the other multi-timeframe indicator variations \u2013 allows traders to display the SMA of a specific timeframe on a chart of a different timeframe.\n\n\nSee \nBollingerMTF\n, \nEmaMTF\n.\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\nThe image shows a 5-minute chart with an SMA (14) calculated on 4-hour bars\n\n\n\n\nSMMA - Smoothed Moving Average\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Smoothed Moving Average is combined from both Simple Moving Average and the Exponential Moving Average.

The weightings are not linear, but instead take on a triangular pattern. To demonstrate, the weighting for a 7-period average would be 1,2,3,4,3,2,1.

What this means is that day 2 is divided by day 1, day 3 by day 2 and so on and so forth, and this is then applied to a triple exponential moving average of the closing prices. This results in a zero line fluctuating oscillator which is used as trend indicator thanks to its stability.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nA buy signal is created when the TRIX indicator crosses the zero line from bottom to top.

This produces a smooth, soft indicator line. The parameter tCount allows the trader to set the number of reiterations.

For each day with a positive close, the volume is added cumulatively, and it is subtracted for days with a close that is smaller than the open.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nGranville theorized that volume precedes price. OBV rises when volume on up days outpaces volume on down days. OBV falls when volume on down days is stronger. A rising OBV reflects positive volume pressure that can lead to higher prices. Conversely, falling OBV reflects negative volume pressure that can foreshadow lower prices. Granville noted in his research that OBV would often move before price. Expect prices to move higher if OBV is rising while prices are either flat or moving down. Expect prices to move lower if OBV is falling while prices are either flat or moving up.\n\n\nThe absolute value of OBV is not important. Chartists should instead focus on the characteristics of the OBV line. First define the trend for OBV. Second, determine if the current trend matches the trend for the underlying security. Third, look for potential support or resistance levels. Once broken, the trend for OBV will change and these breaks can be used to generate signals. Also notice that OBV is based on closing prices. Therefore, closing prices should be considered when looking for divergences or support/resistance breaks. And finally, volume spikes can sometimes throw off the indicator by causing a sharp move that will require a settling period.

Point 2 is often situated at the high of a bar, and point 3 at the low of the same bar. Depending on the timeframe and fluctuation range, T0 and T1 can be fused into one.\n\n\nThe indicator determines the selected timeframe of the chart, and then labels all trends and trend sizes accordingly. When there is low volatility, trend recognition is more sensitive, and the vice versa for higher volatility. The P123\u2019s adaptive methods make for a balanced recognition of trend sizes.\n\n\nImportant tip:\n\n\nIn some cases, the large trend (T0) cannot be seen with the naked eye, which may be due to the fact that not enough candles are visible within the chart. A minimum of 500 candles should be loaded to ensure this is not the case.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nTrading signals often form at points 2 \n 3: at point 3 as entry signals into a correction phase within a confirmed trend, and at point 2 as a sub-trend in the trend direction of the superior trade. The definition of a trend at points 1 to 3 can be read in \"\nDas gro\u00dfe Buch der Markttechnik\n\" by Michael Voigt (German only).\n\n\nVisualization in the chart\n\n\nThe parameter input settings define which trend sizes are shown in the chart and whether or not they are connected by a line.\n\n\nFor the default settings, the trend T2 is enabled by default.\n\n\nThe depiction in the chart may change with the changing market movements. If the market moves below the last point 3 and breaks the uptrend, the point is marked with a \u201c3?\u201d. The newly created low becomes the new point 2 and the last point 2 becomes point 1.\n\n\n\n\nThe parameter settings are not relevant for the display in the chart and are primarily used for the Condition Escort.\n\n\nThe depiction in the chart is primarily influenced by the settings \u201cDisplay 123\u201d and \u201cDisplay Lines\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nThe settings highlighted in yellow have no influence on the chart.

Wilder named this the \"Parabolic Time/Price System.\" SAR signifies \"stop and reverse,\" which is the name of the actual indicator used in his system, where \nSAR trails price as the trend extends over time\n. When prices are rising, the indicator is below them, and when prices are falling, it is above them. Therefore the indicator stops and reverses when the price trend reverses and breaks either above or below the indicator.\n\n\nWilder used his new book, New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems, to introduce the Parabolic Time/Price System in 1978. The book also discusses RSI, Average True Range, and the Directional Movement Concept (ADX). Although they were created before the computer age, Wilder's indicators function equally well today and have a high reputation.\n\n\nSAR follows the price, and can be considered a trend-following indicator. If a downtrend reverses and starts up, SAR follows the prices just like a trailing stop. This stop continues to rise so long as the uptrend remains intact, which means that the SAR never decreases in an uptrend and is always protecting profits as prices move forwards. Once the price stops rising and reverses below SAR, a downtrend starts and SAR is above the price. SAR follows prices lower like a trailing stop, as mentioned before. The stop continuously falls as long as the downtrend continues to exist. Due to the fact that SAR never rises in a downtrend, it always protects profits on short positions.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nVTAD: \nhttp://vtadwiki.vtad.de/index.php/Parabolic_SAR\n\n\nWikipedia: \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabolic_SAR\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nParabolicSAR(double acceleration, double accelerationStep, double accelerationMax)\nParabolicSAR(IDataSeries input, double acceleration, double accelerationStep, double accelerationMax)\nParabolicSAR(double acceleration, double accelerationStep, double accelerationMax)[int barsAgo]\nParabolicSAR(IDataSeries input, double acceleration, double accelerationStep, double accelerationMax)[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nParabolicSAR\n(...)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nacceleration\n\n\nAcceleration\n\n\n\n\n\n\naccelerationStep\n\n\nIncrement of the acceleration\n\n\n\n\n\n\naccelerationMax\n\n\nMaximum acceleration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInSeries\n\n\nInput data series for the indicator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output of the value for the PSAR\nPrint(\nThe current value for the Parabolic SAR is \n + ParabolicSAR(0.02, 0.2, 0.02)[0]);\n\n\n\n\nPercentage Price Oscillator (PPO)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Percentage Price Oscillator displays the percentage difference between two moving averages. It is classed as a momentum indicator and is similar to the MACD in its construction.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe PPO can be used for divergence analysis.

The trader can specify which data series the entry value should be (highs, lows, closing price, another indicator etc.).\n\n\nIt is possible to use an SMA as the entry value. In this case, the upper and lower bands will be displayed with a distance of 1.5%.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nSimilarly to the Bollinger Bands, the Percent Envelope indicator can be used to make buy or sell decisions and to determine whether the price is under- or overvalued.\n\n\nThe Percent Envelope should never be used to make decisions based solely on the output, but should be used in conjunction with other indicators to confirm signals.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nPercentEnvelopes(double percent)\nPercentEnvelopes(IDataSeries input, double percent)\n\n//For the upper band\nPercentEnvelopes(double percent).UpperPercentBand[int barsAgo]\nPercentEnvelopes(IDataSeries input, double percent).UpperPercentBand[int barsAgo]\n\n//For the lower band\nPercentEnvelopes(double percent).LowerPercentBand[int barsAgo]\nPercentEnvelopes(IDataSeries input, double percent).LowerPercentBand[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nPercentEnvelopes\n(2)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\npercent Difference in % for the bands (from the input value)\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output for the upper band\nPrint(\nValue of the upper percent band is: \n + PercentEnvelopes(3).UpperPercentBand[0]);\n\n//Output for the lower band\nPrint(\nValue of the lower percent band is: \n + PercentEnvelopes(3).LowerPercentBand[0]);\n\n\n\n\nPivot Points\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis indicator, based on the price zone approach invented by Dr. Bruce Gould, has been honed over the years. In the beginning, the price zones were calculated using the price developments of the last 2-3 years. Nowadays, however, the practical concept of pivot points is taken from the calculation of price zones in the daily chart, using the previous day\u2019s periods as the basis. The goal hereby is to determine price levels that one could use as potential resistance zones (R1..R3) or support zones (S1..S3). The following methods can be used to calculate the indicator: Classic, Floor, Woodie, Camarilla, Fibonacci. The Classic and Floor methods are often wrongly named within literature, which is why in AgenaTrader you will find that the Classic method is labeled as \u201cFloor\u201d and vice versa. The indicator displays the pivot points for intraday charts, and the parameter \u201cShowPrices\u201d allows you to display the price on the levels. The parameter \u201cDaysBack\u201d allows you to set the number of periods in the past that should be used for the calculation. The line coloring can be defined manually\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nTraders prefer to sell above the resistance lines 1 \n 2 (e.g. to build up short positions), and to start building up tactical long positions at the support lines.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nhttp://www.finanznachrichten.de/nachrichten-2008-01/9833653-was-sind-pivot-punkte-und-wie-kann-ich-sie-handeln-005.htm\n\n\nhttp://www.aktienboard.com/forum/f38/7-kapitel-pivot-points-t36428/\n\n\nhttp://www.forexschule.com/schule/wie-man-mit-hilfe-von-pivot-punkten-handelt-50\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nPivotPoints()\nPivotPoints(PivotPointsMode mode)\nPivotPoints(PivotPointsMode mode, int LineWidth, bool ShowPrices, int DaysBack, Color RColor, Color PPColor, Color SColor)\nPivotPoints(IDataSeries input, PivotPointsMode mode, int LineWidth, bool ShowPrices, int DaysBack, Color RColor, Color PPColor, Color SColor)\nPivotPoints()[barsAgo]\nPivotPoints(PivotPointsMode mode)[barsAgo]\nPivotPoints(PivotPointsMode mode, int LineWidth, bool ShowPrices, int DaysBack, Color RColor, Color PPColor, Color SColor)[barsAgo]\nPivotPoints(IDataSeries input, PivotPointsMode mode, int LineWidth, bool ShowPrices, int DaysBack, Color RColor, Color PPColor, Color SColor)[barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\nThis class has the following public methods (as data series), which all return double values:\n\n\nPP, S1, S2, S3, R1, R2 ,R3\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nPivotPoints().PP[int barsAgo]\nPivotPoints(PivotPointsMode.Classic).S3[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nParameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInSeries\n\n\nInput data series for the indicator\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPivotPointsMode\n\n\nCalculatory method\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPivotPointsMode.Classic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPivotPointsMode.Floor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPivotPointsMode.Woodie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPivotPointsMode.Camarilla\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPivotPointsMode.Fibonacci\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault: floor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLineWidth\n\n\nDefault: 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShowPrices\n\n\nShows prices next to the lines\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault: false\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaysBack\n\n\nThe number of historical periods to be included in the display of the pivot lines\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault: 0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRColor\n\n\nResistance line color\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPPColor\n\n\nPivot line color\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSColor\n\n\nSupport line color\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output current pivot point\nPrint(\nThe floor pivot point is located at: \n + PivotPoints()[0]);\n//Output first support (S1)\nPrint(\nThe first pivot support (S1) is at: \n + PivotPoints().S1[0]);\n\n\n\n\nCalculation\n\n\nH=yesterday\u2019s high, L=yesterday\u2019s low, O=yesterday\u2019s open, C=yesterday\u2019s close\n\n\nRange = H-L\n\n\nClassic\n\n\npp = (H + L + C)/3\n\n\nr1 = 2*pp - L\n\n\ns1 = 2*pp - H\n\n\nr2 = pp - s1 + r1\n\n\ns2 = pp - r1 + s1\n\n\nr3 = H + 2*(pp - L)\n\n\ns3 = L - 2*(H - pp)\n\n\nFloor\n\n\npp = (H + L + C)/3\n\n\nr1 = 2*pp - L\n\n\ns1 = 2*pp - H\n\n\nr2 = pp + Range\n\n\ns2 = pp - Range\n\n\nr3 = pp + 2*Range\n\n\ns3 = pp - 2*Range\n\n\nWoodie\n\n\npp = (H + L + 2*C)/4\n\n\nr1 = 2*pp - L\n\n\ns1 = 2*pp - H\n\n\nr2 = pp + H - L\n\n\ns2 = pp - H + L\n\n\nr3 = 0.0\n\n\ns3 = 0.0\n\n\nCamarilla\n\n\npp = (H + L + C)/3\n\n\nr1 = C + Range * 1.1 / 12\n\n\ns1 = C - Range * 1.1 / 12\n\n\nr2 = C + Range * 1.1 / 6\n\n\ns2 = C - Range * 1.1 / 6\n\n\nr3 = C + Range * 1.1 / 4\n\n\ns3 = C - Range * 1.1 / 4\n\n\nFibonacci\n\n\npp = (H + L + C)/3\n\n\nr1 = pp + 0.382 * Range\n\n\ns1 = pp - 0.382 * Range\n\n\nr2 = pp + 0.618 * Range\n\n\ns2 = pp - 0.618 * Range\n\n\nr3 = pp + 0.764 * Range\n\n\ns3 = pp - 0.764 * Range\n\n\nPolarized Fractal Efficiency (PFE)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nHans Hannula developed the PFE, which is categorized as a momentum indicator.

When divergence in all lines is substantial - this is a signal of a strong up- or downtrend movement.\nBy default red lines are the closest to the chart and represent the moving average line with the smallest time period.  Yellow lines indicate short-term trends. Blue display the area for short-term traders\u2019 activity. Green is typify for medium-term trends.

Default setting is the EMA (exponential moving average) but it is possible to choose a simple (SMA), hull (HMA) and weighted (WMA) moving average lines\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLow MA Period\n\n\nShows the smallest amount of time periods for which the moving average will be calculated. For example, the setting \u201c2\u201d for the daily chart indicates the two latest daily closing prices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh MA Period\n\n\nShows the largest amount of time periods for which the moving average will be calculated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\n\n\nDefines the amount of moving average lines shown on a chart within the rainbow indicator.

Welles Wilder, the creator of several indicators, also developed the RSI, which is one of the most popular, useful momentum oscillators. It compares the size of the most recent profits with the size of the most recent losses, which means that it assesses the relationships between the up and down closing prices. The values are shown between 0 and 100.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nTraditionally, and according to Wilder, RSI is considered overbought when above 70 and oversold when below 30. Signals can also be generated by searching for divergences, failure swings and centerline crossovers. RSI can also be used to identify the general trend. These traditional levels can also be adjusted to better fit the security or analytical requirements. Raising overbought to 80 or lowering oversold to 20 will reduce the number of overbought/oversold readings. Short-term traders sometimes use 2-period RSI to look for overbought readings above 80 and oversold readings below 20.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nhttp://technische-analyse.eu/index.php?title=RSI\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nRSI(int period, int smooth)\nRSI(IDataSeries input, int period, int smooth)\nRSI(int period, int smooth)[int barsAgo]\nRSI(IDataSeries input, int period, int smooth)[int barsAgo]\n\n//For the average value\nRSI(int period, int smooth).Avg[int barsAgo]\nRSI(IDataSeries input, int period, int smooth).Avg[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nRSI\n(14,3)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nsmooth Number of periods for the smoothing\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output for the RSI\nPrint(\nThe current value for the RSI is: \n + RSI(14, 3)[0]);\n\n//Output for the average line\nPrint(\nThe current value for the AVG line is: \n + RSI(14, 3).Avg[0]);\n\n\n\n\nRelative Strength Levy (RSL)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe concept of the Relative Strength according to R.A. Levy is that the past developments play a very important role in the strength that will be seen in the future. The current performance is compared to the past performance.\n\n\nThe calculation involves taking the weekly closes (or daily closes) and dividing them by the arithmetic mean of the closing prices for the examined period. The result is then balanced around the 10 marker, and an ordered list is created where the value of the highest RSL fills the first place.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nRSL(int period)\nRSLDataSeries input, int period)\nRSLnt period)[int barsAgo]\nRSL(IDataSeries input, int period)[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nRSL\n(27)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//RSL value output\nPrint(\nThe Relative Strength as calculated by Levy is \n + RSL(27)[0]);\n\n\n\n\nRelative Volatility Index (RVI)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Relative Volatility Index (RVI) has many similarities to the RSI indicator. Donald Dorsey developed the RVI, which uses the standard deviation instead of the daily price span. To determine the underlying volatility of the instrument, the RVI uses the standard deviation over a period of 10. The RSI indicator is then used on the results, which normalizes them. What comes from this is displayed on a scale of 1 to 100.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nValues above 50 assume an increase in volatility. Values below 50 imply a drop in volatility.

R-Squared is the correlation coefficient that specifies the quality of the linear regression line.\n\n\nIt is the calculation that gives R-Squared its name \u2013 the value is the square of the correlation coefficient, which in mathematics is prefixed with the Greek letter Rho (P).\n\n\nSee \nLinear Regression\n, \nLinRegSlope\n, \nLinRegIntercept\n.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe value of the oscillator fluctuates between 0 and 1. By default, the upper boundary line is located at 0.75, and the lower border is at 0.2.\nIf the prices are in a sideways movement, the data is scattered around the regression line. R-Squared will have a value of 0 in the aforementioned situation.\nIn a strong trend phase, the prices will remain within a tight range for an extended period of time; if these are located close to the regression line then the R-Squared indicator will have a value of 1. Stanley Kroll and Tuchar Chande used the correlation coefficient as a trend filter in their book \u201c\nThe new technical trader\n\u201d.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nhttp://www.blastchart.com/Community/IndicatorGuide/Indicators/LinearRegressionRSquared.aspx\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nRSquared(int period)\nRSquared(IDataSeries input, int period)\nRSquared(int period)[int barsAgo]\nRSquared(IDataSeries input, int period)[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nRSquared\n(8)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output for the value of R-Squared\nPrint(\nThe current value of R-Squared is: \n + RSquared(8)[0]);\n\n\n\n\nStandardDeviation(StdDev)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Standard Deviation  (StdDev) is a tool used in statistics and probability calculation. It measures the dispersion of the values of a random variable around its median value. The Standard Deviation is used for the calculation of many indicators, such as, for example, the Bollinger Bands.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nA lower standard deviation implies that the data points are located very close to their median value. The trading application assumes that prices will return to their median value.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nVTAD: \nhttp://vtadwiki.vtad.de/index.php/Standard_Abweichung\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nStdDev (int period)\nStdDev (IDataSeries input, int period)\nStdDev (int period)[int barsAgo]\nStdDev (IDataSeries input, int period)[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nStdDev\n(14)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output for the StdDev\nPrint(\nThe current value for the standard deviation is: \n + StdDev(14)[0]);\n\n\n\n\nStandard Error (StdError)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nJon Anderson came up with the Standard Error Bands, which are similar to the Bollinger Bands, but with a different calculation. An upper and a lower boundary around a middle line create the bands \u2013 this is also known as the linear regression. The lower standard error band results from the subtraction of two standard errors from the final value of the regression line. Because individual closing prices can have a huge influence on the values of the bands, it is necessary to use a Simple Moving Average to smooth the data.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nOne of the applications of the standard error bands is the tightening of the bands when prices rise/fall. If the bands tighten, it signifies that a trend is currently in place. A strong trend will continue to tighten the bands.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nhttp://www.forexrealm.com/technical-analysis/technical-indicators/standard-error-bands.html\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nStdError(int period)\nStdError(IDataSeries input, int period)\nStdError(int period)[int barsAgo]\nStdError(IDataSeries input, int period)[int barsAgo]\n\n//Upper band\nStdError(int period).Upper[int barsAgo]\nStdError(IDataSeries input, int period).Upper[int barsAgo]\n\n//Lower band\nStdError(int period).Lower[int barsAgo]\nStdError(IDataSeries input, int period).Lower[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nStdError\n(21)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output for the values of the middle line\nPrint(\nThe middle line is currently at: \n + StdError(21)[0]);\n\n//Output for the lower band\nPrint(\nThe lower band of the standard error is currently at: \n + StdError(21).Lower[0]);\n\n//output for the upper band\nPrint(\nThe upper band of the standard error is currently at: \n + StdError(21).Upper[0]);\n\n\n\n\nStochastics\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe stochastic indicator was developed by George C. Lane in the 1950s. It belongs to the class \u201cmomentum indicators\u201d (oscillators) and represents the current closing price in relation to a high or low area over a defined number of periods.\nThe stochastic indicator is based on the observation that in an uptrend, the closing price is close to the daily high, while in a downtrend, the closing price is closer to the daily low.\nThe stochastic indicator consists of two exponential Average Lines (%K and %D), both of which range between 0 and 100.\nThere are two types of stochastic: the classic slow stochastic and the fast stochastic.\n\n\nFast stochastic:\n\nThe %D line is the smoothing average of the %K line\n\n\nSlow stochastic:\n\nThe %D is the basis on which the smoothing average is calculated. The slow stochastic smoothes the fast stochastic, thus stabilizing the oscillator.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe closing prices found in the upper area imply an accumulation (buying pressure); the lower area represents selling pressure.\nThe stochastic indicator is a classic oscillator, and is primarily used in sideways markets in order to determine the reversal points. Days with a stable trend will not provide the indicator with any relevant or valuable results/information.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nVTAD: \nhttp://vtadwiki.vtad.de/index.php/Stochastik\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nStochastics(int periodD, int periodK, int smooth)\nStochastics(IDataSeries input, int periodD, int periodK, int smooth)\n\n//For the %D line\nStochastics(int periodD, int periodK, int smooth).D[int barsAgo]\nStochastics(IDataSeries input, int periodD, int periodK, int smooth).D[int barsAgo]\n\n//For the %K line\nStochastics(int periodD, int periodK, int smooth).K[int barsAgo]\nStochastics(IDataSeries input, int periodD, int periodK, int smooth).K[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nStochastics\n(7,14,3)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiodD Number of periods to be used for the %K smoothing\n\n\nperiodK Number of bars included in the %K calculation\n\n\nsmooth Number of periods for the smoothing of %D\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output for the %K line\nPrint(\nThe stochastic line %K is currently at: \n + Stochastics(3, 14, 7).K[0]);\n\n//Output for the %D line\nPrint(\nThe stochastic line %D is currently at: \n + Stochastics(3, 14, 7).D[0]);\n\n\n\n\nStochastics Fast\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nSee \nstochastics\n.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nClosing prices that are constantly in the upper area indicate accumulation (i.e. buying pressure), whilst the distribution (i.e. selling pressure) is shown by an indicator value in the lower area.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nVTAD: \nhttp://vtadwiki.vtad.de/index.php/Stochastik\n\n\nCharttec: \nhttp://www.charttec.de/html/indikator_stochastics.php\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nStochasticsFast(int periodD, int periodK)\nStochasticsFast(IDataSeries input, int periodD, int periodK)\n\n//For the %D line\nStochasticsFast(int periodD, int periodK).D[int barsAgo]\nStochasticsFast(IDataSeries input, int periodD, int periodK).D[int barsAgo]\n\n//For the %K line\nStochasticsFast(int periodD, int periodK).K[int barsAgo]\nStochasticsFast(IDataSeries input, int periodD, int periodK).K[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nStochasticsFast\n(7,14)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiodD Number of periods for the smoothing of %K\n\n\nperiodK Number of periods included in the calculation of %K\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output for the %K line of the fast stochastic\nPrint(\nThe stochastic line %K is currently at: \n + StochasticsFast(3, 14).K[0]);\n\n//Output %D line\nPrint(\nThe stochastic line %D is currently at: \n + StochasticsFast(3, 14).D[0]);\n\n\n\n\nStochastics RSI (StochRSI)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nStochastics RSI is a calculation of the stochastic based on the RSI indicator.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe indicator provides fast and precise extreme values/points in the price movements.

SuperTrend is similar to the Parabolic Stop and Reverse System (Parabolic SAR), and is based on the median values of the candles. It measures volatility as a span between high and low, not taking potential price gaps into account. The indicator, which originates from a starting value, continues to proceed in one direction until the market changes direction, combined with rising volatility. This causes the indicator to adjust its starting value to match that of the counter-direction. The indicator is programmed in such a way that nothing but the trend direction can bring about a change. Dropping volatility combined with movements against the trend direction cause the indicator to move horizontally.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThere are multiple interpretations and applications for the SuperTrend. Forex traders prefer to trade the crosses directly. This way, the system will continuously be inside the market and only needs to be complemented by a stop and further trading logic settings.\nAnalytically speaking, the SuperTrend indicator is only able to provide information about the current trend. If the market is above the indicator, then an uptrend exists, otherwise a downtrend is in force.\nThe indicator can be used as an exit for additional trading systems, meaning that an open position can be closed if a trend change occurs.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nSuperTrend(SuperTrendMode stMode, int length, double multiplier, SuperTrendMAType maType, int smooth)\nSuperTrend(IDataSeries input, SuperTrendMode stMode, int length, double multiplier, SuperTrendMAType maType, int smooth)\nSuperTrend(SuperTrendMode stMode, int length, double multiplier, SuperTrendMAType maType, int smooth)[int barsAgo]\nSuperTrend(IDataSeries input, SuperTrendMode stMode, int length, double multiplier, SuperTrendMAType maType, int smooth)[int barsAgo]\n\n//For the values of the uptrend:\nSuperTrend(SuperTrendMode stMode, int length, double multiplier, SuperTrendMAType maType, int smooth).UpTrend[int barsAgo]\nSuperTrend(IDataSeries input, SuperTrendMode stMode, int length, double multiplier, SuperTrendMAType maType, int smooth).UpTrend[int barsAgo]\n\n//For the values of the downtrend:\nSuperTrend(SuperTrendMode stMode, int length, double multiplier, SuperTrendMAType maType, int smooth).DownTrend[int barsAgo]\nSuperTrend(IDataSeries input, SuperTrendMode stMode, int length, double multiplier, SuperTrendMAType maType, int smooth).DownTrend[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nSuperTrend\n(...).UpTrend[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInSeries\n\n\nInput data series for the indicator\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaType\n\n\nFor the calculation of the MA, the following methods can be used:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuperTrendMAType.HMA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuperTrendMAType.SMA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuperTrendMAType.SMMA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuperTrendMAType.TEMA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuperTrendMAType.TMA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuperTrendMAType.VMA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuperTrendMAType.VWMA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuperTrendMAType.WMA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso see: \nHMA\n, \nSMA\n, \nSMMA\n, \nTEMA\n, \nTMA\n, \nVMA\n, \nVWMA\n, \nWMA\n.\nDefault:\n              HMA  |\n| multiplier | This is a multiplier for the internal calculation of the offset.

The number of bars to the left and right of the extreme point is the determining factor for the strength. Methods for these indicators can also be implemented for other scripts.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe methods for these indicators can be used in scripts to determine the last extreme point and its corresponding price value.

Here, the trend is established based on a regression equation that uses the smallest square formula. The goal of the TSF is to anticipate future price movements with the help of currently existing data.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe TSF reacts faster than the moving averages.

For example, a trader located in Germany will receive EURUSD data that beginning on Sunday evenings in America.\nTo add the couple of hours that are transcribed on Sunday to the previous Friday\u2019s session, you simply need to set IncludeWeekends = true.\nThe first picture shows IncludeWeekends = false:\n\n\n\n\nThe second picture shows IncludeWeekends = true:\n\n\n\n\nShow Prices parameter\n\nIf set to \u201ctrue\u201d, prices are displayed in addition to the line itself.\n\n\n\n\nExtend high lines and Extend low lines parameters.\n\nIf set to \u201ctrue\u201d, the highs and lows that have not yet been \u201ebreached\u201c by the price will be extended onto the right-hand side of the chart using dotted lines.\n\n\n\n\nGetDayBar\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe function GetDayBar() outputs all values (open, high, low, close, time, median, typical, volume, and weighted) for a specified past or current day i.e. session. GetDayBar() is not intended to be used inside the chart. For this purpose, DayLinesAdv should be used instead. GetDayBar is mainly used as a high-performance replacement for \nPriorDayOHLC\n.\n\n\nSeveral data feed providers also offer historical data, in which case we recommend that you use GetDayBar. If it is intraday data that is offered, it still works adequately to use \nPriorDayOHLC\n.\n\n\nIf the outputted data varies, the main cause is normally assumed to be the difference between Session Begin and Session End.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ndaysAgo Number of days in the past\n(0 for the current value)\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\nDateTime for time\ndouble for all other values\n\n\nFor \ndaysAgo = 0,\n the following applies:\nClose = current price (for CalculateOnClosedBar = false)\nTime = time of the current day\u2019s open\nAll other values are calculated using intraday data.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nGetDayBar (int daysAgo)\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n[TimeFrameRequirements(\n1 day\n)]\npublic class xy : UserIndicator\n{\n  int daysAgo = 5;\n  double historicalClose = Instrument.Round2TickSize(GetDayBar(daysAgo).Close);\n}\n\nprotected override void OnStart()\n{\n  Print(\nThe closing price from \n + daysAgo + \n days ago was at \n + historicalClose);\n}\n\n\n\n\nImportant:\n\nThe attribute \nTimeFrameRequirements\n must also always be used for the class doing the calling up (in the above example, class xy) if the indicator uses \nMultibars\n.\n\n\nInfo\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nInfo is not an indicator in the classic sense of the word, but is actually more similar to a tool.

If the parameter IncludeWeekends is set to \u201ctrue\u201d, then the Sunday sessions will be added to the Friday\u2019s session.\nSee \nPriorDayOHLC\n.\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nShowBidAsk\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe ShowBidAsk indicator displays the current bid and ask prices as well as the corresponding volume within the lower part of the chart. It also shows changes in volume even if a trade has not occurred.\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nTickCounter\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nTickCounter provides information regarding the current number of ticks that are contained within the bar. The indicator can not only count starting from 0, but can also be set to count from a specified number down to 0. TickCounter can display the value either as absolute or as a percentage. It only works with candle charts in which the bars are established based on a fixed number of ticks.\n\n\nWhen programming your own scripts, please use Bars, TicksCountForLastBar or Bars, LastBarCompleteness.\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nTrue Strength Index (TSI)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe True Strength Index (TSI) is a momentum indicator. It is used as an indicator for trend direction and for displaying overbought or oversold conditions.\nAs a rule, momentum oscillators preemptively indicate price changes, whereas moving averages generally lag behind the price. The TSI brings together the advantages of these two indicator groups.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe TSI line moves between 100 and -100. Most values are between +25 and -25. These trigger lines can be used to anticipate overbought or oversold situations. A rising TSI signals an uptrend, while falling TSI suggests a downtrend.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_strength_index\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nTSI(int fast, int slow)\nTSI(IDataSeries input, int fast, int slow)\nTSI(int fast, int slow)[int barsAgo]\nTSI(IDataSeries input, int fast, int slow)[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nTSI\n(3,14)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nfast Number of bars included in the calculation of the fast EMA\n\n\nslow Number of bars included in the calculation of the slow EMA\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output of the current value for the True Strength Index (TSI)\nPrint(\nThe current value for the TSI is \n + TSI(3, 14)[0]);\n\n\n\n\nUltimate Oscillator\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nLarry Williams developed the Ultimate Oscillator, which was first published in 1985. The Ultimate Oscillator is calculated by means of taking the weighted sum of three oscillators in different timeframes. These three timeframes are the short-term, middle and long-term market cycles. The typical period lengths used are 7, 14 and 28, and the value of the indicator moves between 0 and 100. Values above 70 signify an overbought situation, and values below 30 show that it is oversold.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nWilliams defined the following criteria for a buy signal:\n\n\nA bullish divergence between price and oscillator can be observed, meaning that the market makes a new low but the oscillator remains unchanged.\n\n\nWhile this divergence is forming, the oscillator falls below 30.\n\n\nThe oscillator will then resume its upward move towards the high at which it peaked before the divergence began forming.\n\n\nThe buy signal is created when the price breaches that last high.\n\n\nThe long position is closed if the oscillator rises above 70 or if the oscillator rises above 50 and then falls back below 45.\nA sell signal consists of bearish divergences forming above 70. These positions are closed once the 30 level marker is breached.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nUltimateOscillator(int fast, int intermediate, int slow)\nUltimateOscillator(IDataSeries input, int fast, int intermediate, int slow)\nUltimateOscillator(int fast, int intermediate, int slow)[int barsAgo]\nUltimateOscillator(IDataSeries input, int fast, int intermediate, int slow)[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nUltimateOscillator\n (5)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninput\n\n\nInput data series for the indicator\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfast\n\n\nNumber of bars for the calculation of the short-term oscillator\n\n\n\n\n\n\nintermediate\n\n\nNumber of bars for the calculation of the intermediate oscillator\n\n\n\n\n\n\nslow\n\n\nNumber of bars for the calculation of the slow indicator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n// Output of the values for the UltimateOscillator with settings of 7,14,28\nPrint(\nThe current value for the Ultimate Oscillator is \n + UltimateOscillator(7, 14, 28)[0]);\n\n\n\n\nVolume (VOL)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis is the volume for the shares, futures, ETFs and so on that are traded within a specified time period.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nhttp://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volumenanalyse\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nVOL()\nVOL(IDataSeries input)\nVOL()[int barsAgo]\nVOL(IDataSeries input)[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nVOL\n()[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameter\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output of the current volume\nPrint(\nThe current volume is \n + VOL()[0]);\n\n\n\n\nVolume Moving Average (VOLMA)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe VOLMA calculation is carried out by applying an exponential moving average to the respective volume of each period, that is to say its EMA (volume).\n\n\nCaution:\n\nIn trading literature, the Volume Moving Average is often confused with the abbreviation for the Variable Moving Average (VMA).\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe VOLMA indicator helps you to find and assess the relative volume of a period.\n\n\nSome simple guidelines should be followed:\n\n\nThe volume should be above the VOLMA at a break\n\n\nAfter a volume spike (high), an exhaustion phase will kick in. The exhaustion can lead to a complete reversal of the price movement. Generally speaking, however, this is simply a resting phase\n\n\nAfter three successive volume spikes, it becomes much less likely that the situation will continue in the same direction\n\n\nHere, you can find more general information about \nMoving Averages\n.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nVolumen-Analyse.de: \nhttp://www.volumen-analyse.de\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nVOLMA(int period)\nVOLMA(IDataSeries input, int period)\nVOLMA(int period)[int barsAgo]\nVOLMA(IDataSeries input, int period)[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nVOLMA\n(14)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output for the value of the Volume Moving Average (VOLMA)\nPrint(\nThe current VOLMA value is \n + VOLMA(14)[0]);\n\n\n\n\nVolume Oscillator\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Volume Oscillator makes use of the difference between the moving averages based on the trading volume, with a similar result to the MACD or to any other oscillator in which moving averages are used for calculation.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe Volume Oscillator is used to determine the trend strength. If developments in the price of the share are accompanied by disproportionate volume oscillator values, this should be regarded as highly relevant. In this way, the indicator can be used to filter out false signals.\nValues above zero mean that the shortest moving average of the volume is above the long-term moving average.

In this histogram, every bar depicts the cumulative traded volume for a certain price level. The starting bar for the calculations is labeled with a \u201c#\u201d.\nThese bars inside the histogram have various colors: green indicates executions at or above the ask, which are interpreted as buys. Red means trades at or below the bid, which are interpreted as sells. Grey signifies neutral executions.\nIt is important to note that the Volume Profile indicator only works together with a real-time data feed. After changes have been made in the properties window, the indicator is restarted and all values that have been calculated up to this point are lost.\n\n\nSee: \nVolumeZones\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nPrices with especially high trading volume will have a more satiated accumulation and distribution at their respective levels. This leads to price resistance/support zones being formed.\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nVolume Rate of Change (VROC)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Volume Rate of Change (VROC) is almost exactly the same as the ROC indicator, with the exception that instead of price data, volume data (VOL) is used. A smoothing component is also applied.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nhttp://www.shareholder24.de/boersensoftware-wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=9207904\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nVROC(int period, int smooth)\nVROC(IDataSeries input, int period, int smooth)\nVROC(int period, int smooth)[int barsAgo]\nVROC(IDataSeries input, int period, int smooth)[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nVROC\n(14,3)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nsmooth Number of Bars included in the calculation for the smoothing\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output of the current value for the Volume ROC\nPrint(\nThe current value for the Volume ROC is: \n + VROC(14, 3)[0]);\n\n\n\n\nVolumeArea\n\n\nThe installation of the Technical Analysis Package is required in order to access this indicator.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nSimilarly, with this indicator you can also have your own volume profiles displayed. Here you can now determine the start and end time completely freely by clicking on your desired position. There are no restrictions as to where the calculation should start and end. In the upper right corner you have the setting options with which you can switch between the profile types (for a description of these, read more under VolumeSessionPro). With a click on the little red \u201c+\u201d under the profile settings, you can add a further volume profile to your chart; you do so by once again determining the start and end time by left-clicking.\n The settings and the display of the indicator are exactly equivalent to the VolumeSessionPro: via ProfileType you select which calculation method should be used; via ValueArea you determine the percentage for what portion of the volume area should be colored with the highest activity. \nThe most effective way of working with the VolumeArea is to place this indicator in the action bar and assign it a hot key. In this way, if necessary, the indicator can be quickly called up and you can specify the desired volume area.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\nto be announced\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\nto be announced\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nto be announced\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nto be announced\n\n\nVolumeGraph\n\n\nThe installation of the Technical Analysis Package is required in order to access this indicator.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis indicator contains a normal volume histogram, but here, the coloring takes place based on price trends. The VolumeGraph determines short- or long-term price trends; you can set the sensitivity for this using the parameter \u201cSlopeLength\u201d. A high value delivers long-term trends; low values represent short-term price trends. Using the setting \u201cExponential\u201d, you can select whether the calculation for trend determination should be based on an exponential (=True) or linear (=False) algorithm. This is about the fine-tuning, and no large changes should be expected with this parameter. In addition, the volume histogram also contains a moving average, for which you can enter the period using the parameter \u201cAvgLength\u201d.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\nto be announced\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\nto be announced\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nto be announced\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nto be announced\n\n\nVolumeKeltnerChannels\n\n\nThe installation of the Technical Analysis Package is required in order to access this indicator.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe VolumeKeltnerChannels are a great tool to determine very high or very low volume in comparison to past periods. Beginning with an upper Keltner channel line calculated with volume data, this line is shifted ever further upwards or downwards using special multipliers. Volume that is higher than the highest Keltner channel line can be interpreted as extremely high volume that shows that huge numbers of trades have been carried out in the current price period and that an unusually large number of traders are buying or selling positions at the current price level.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\nto be announced\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\nto be announced\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nto be announced\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nto be announced\n\n\nVolumeRiseFall\n\n\nThe installation of the Technical Analysis Package is required in order to access this indicator.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe VolumeRiseFall indicator is a normal volume display as volume bars, with, however, a different coloring than normal.

You can determine the start time and the length of a session however you wish. For each session, the VolumeProfile is then shown. Use this indicator only in timeframes smaller than 1 day; the smaller the timeframe selected, the more detailed the display of the VolumeProfile. The price at which the most volume was traded in the respective session is shown as a red bar. The price area in which, for example, 70% of the trading activity for the respective session took place, is colored light blue. You can determine this percentage yourself as you wish under the parameter \u201cValueArea\u201d. Furthermore, you have four different options for displaying the volume information:\n\n\nFurthermore, you have four different options for displaying the volume information: \n\n\n4.1.1. VOC (Volume on close):\n Loads the entire volume of a bar at the closing price of this bar \u2013 e.g. if a 5-minute bar has a volume of 280 and a range of 1.5 points with a closing price at 1534.25, all 280 volume units are counted at the closing price of 1534.24.\n\n\n4.1.2. TPO (Time price opportunity):\n This method does not take the actual traded volume into account, but instead counts an individual volume unit for each price in the traded range of the bar \u2013 e.g. if a 5-minute bar has its high at 1534 and its low at 1532.5, then one volume unit is counted for each of the following prices: 1532.50, 1532.75, 1533.0, 1533.25, 1533.50, 1533.75, and 1534. \n\n\n4.1.3. VWTPO (Volume weighted time price opportunity):\n This version distributes the traded volume of a bar across its price range \u2013 e.g. if a 5-minute bar exhibits a volume of 280 with a range of 1.5 points, with its high at 1534 and low at 1532.5, then 40 volume units (=280/7) are added to each of the seven prices in this range: 1532.50, 1532.75, 1533.0, 1533.25, 1533.50, 1533.75, and 1534.\n\n\n4.1.4. VTPO (Volume time price opportunity):\n Here, the traded volume is added to each price of the range \u2013 e.g. if a 5-minute bar has 280 volume units, a range of 1.5 points with a high at 1534 and low at 1532.5, then 280 volume units are added to each of the seven prices of the range:: 1532.50, 1532.75, 1533.0, 1533.25, 1533.50, 1533.75, and 1534.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\nto be announced\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\nto be announced\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nto be announced\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nto be announced\n\n\nVolumeTickSpeed\n\n\nThe installation of the Technical Analysis Package is required in order to access this indicator.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nATTENTION!\n You can only use this indicator in the tick chart! The indicator measures the number of ticks that are traded during a number of seconds defined by the user. You can set the number of seconds under the parameter \u201cPeriod\u201d. A high tick speed can, therefore, be equated with high trading intensity, which can in turn often be observed at turning points in the market. With the parameter \u201cLimitValue\u201d, you can specify from which number of ticks during the selected period the background should be colored in order to display extreme values.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\nto be announced\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\nto be announced\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nto be announced\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nto be announced\n\n\nVolumeUDR\n\n\nThe installation of the Technical Analysis Package is required in order to access this indicator.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe VolumeUpDownRatio is the relationship between UpVolume and DownVolume, displayed as an oscillator.

This histogram contains the historical volume, and inside the histogram, the length of the bars shows the cumulative volume. Traders can configure the price series (open, high, low etc.) with the help of the properties dialog box.\nAn up bar (where the close is above the open) shows the bar in green, and falling bars are displayed in red. The indicator is only designed to be used with historical data. In order to view volume changes in real-time, it is wise to consider using the VolumeProfile.\n\n\nVolumeZoneOscillator\n\n\nThe installation of the Technical Analysis Package is required in order to access this indicator.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe VolumeZoneOscillator divides the volume activity into UpVolume and DownVolume, similarly to the VolumeUDR. Volume is ranked as UpVolume when the current closing price is located above the prior closing price; vice versa for DownVolume. The oscillator calculated hereby outputs relative percentage values. An instrument is in a positive trend when the VolumeZoneOscillator rises above a level of 5% and vice versa in a negative trend, when it falls below -5%. Values above 40% show overbought situations, while values above 60% are an indication for an extreme exaggeration in the market. On the other hand, values smaller than -40% are deemed oversold and values smaller than -60% to be classified as enormously oversold and exaggerated.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\nto be announced\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\nto be announced\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nto be announced\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nto be announced\n\n\nWilliams %R\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nLarry Williams developed the Williams %R. It is a momentum indicator, and is the inverse of the Fast Stochastic Oscillator. Williams %R, which is also called simply %R, reflects the level of the close relative to the highest high for the look-back period. The Stochastic Oscillator, on the other hand, reflects the level of the close relative to the lowest low. %R multiplies the raw value by -100 as a means of correcting for the inversion. This means that the Fast Stochastic Oscillator and Williams %R actually produce the exact same lines, with different scaling. The Williams %R fluctuates between 0 and -100. Values between 0 to -20 are deemed overbought, and values from -80 to -100 are seen as oversold. Naturally, signals taken from the Stochastic Oscillator can also be applied to Williams %R.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nAs with the Stochastic Oscillator, Williams %R reflects the level of the close relative to the high-low range over a given period of time. Assume that the highest high equals 110, the lowest low equals 100 and the close equals 108. The high-low range is 10 (110 - 100), which is the denominator in the %R formula. The highest high less the close equals 2 (110 - 108), which is the numerator. 2 divided by 10 equals 0.20. Multiply this number by -100 to get -20 for %R. Williams %R would equal -30 if the close was 103 (0.30 x -100).\n\n\nThe centerline, -50, is an important level to watch. Williams %R moves between 0 and -100, which makes -50 the midpoint. Think of it as the 50 yard line in football. The offense has a higher chance of scoring when it crosses the 50 yard line. The defense has an edge as long as it prevents the offense from crossing the 50 yard line. A Williams %R cross above -50 signals that prices are trading in the upper half of their high-low range for the given look-back period. This suggests that the cup is half full. Conversely, a cross below -50 means prices are trading in the bottom half of the given look-back period. This suggests that the cup is half empty.\n\n\nLow readings (below -80) indicate that the price is near its low for the given time period. High readings (above -20) indicate that the price is near its high for the given time period.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nhttp://www.broker-test.de/finanzwissen/technische-analyse/williams-percent-r/\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nWilliamsR(int period)\nWilliamsR(IDataSeries input, int period)\nWilliamsR(int period)[int barsAgo]\nWilliamsR(IDataSeries input, int period)[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nWilliamsR\n(14)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nWilliamsR(int period)\nWilliamsR(IDataSeries input, int period)\nWilliamsR(int period)[int barsAgo]\nWilliamsR(IDataSeries input, int period)[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nWyckoffWave\n\n\nThe installation of the Technical Analysis Package is required in order to access this indicator.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe WyckoffWave indicator adds the volume for each following bar until a price wave is over / finished. You can set the sensitivity of the price waves. When the  volume of a wave rises to particularly high values, is it very often because a turning point in the chart has been reached. When the volume bars are colored red, we are dealing with a short wave; green volume bars indicate a long wave. \n\n\nUsing the parameter \u201cMedianPeriod\u201d you can select how sensitively the indicator should determine the individual price waves. The smaller the value, the larger the price waves that the indicator calculates. \n\n\nThe parameter Poles serves to fine-tune the display of the volume waves; you can select a parameter between 1-4. Changing this value usually causes only imperceptible changes.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\nto be announced\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\nto be announced\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nto be announced\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nto be announced\n\n\nZigZag\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe ZigZag indicator searched for extreme points in different timeframes. It finds the extreme points by using threshold values that traders themselves define. These specified threshold values determine the extent to which the market direction needs to change before the ZigZag line alters its orientation and forms a further extreme point.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe previous extreme values (local highs or lows) are ideally suited for either entries or stop targets.\n\n\nCaution:\n The ZigZag is not an indicator in the common sense. Position and direction of the zigzag can change retrospectively (repainting indicator).\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nhttp://www.robotrading.de/indikatoren/zig-zag-indikator-zeigt-hoch-und-tief-punkte-im-forex-markt\n\n\nUsage\n\n\n//For the upper extreme value\nZigZag(DeviationType deviationType, double deviationValue, bool useHighLow).ZigZagHigh[int barsAgo]\nZigZag(IDataSeries input, DeviationType deviationType, double deviationValue, bool useHighLow).ZigZagHigh[int barsAgo]\n\n//For the lower extreme value\nZigZag(DeviationType deviationType, double deviationValue, bool useHighLow).ZigZagLow[int barsAgo]\nZigZag(IDataSeries input, DeviationType deviationType, double deviationValue, bool useHighLow).ZigZagLow[int barsAgo]\n\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nZigZag\n(...)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nA return value of 0 indicates that no high or low point has been found yet.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninput\n\n\nInput data series for the indicator\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndeviationType\n\n\nThe change in points or percent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeviationType.Points and DeviationType.Percent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndeviationValue\n\n\nValue of the deviation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuseHighLow\n\n\nDefines whether the high/low of a bar will be used for extreme values or if you want to use closing prices instead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output of the market value for the last high point\nPrint(\nThe last high of the ZigZag indicator was at \n + ZigZag(DeviationType.Percent, 1, true).ZigZagHigh[0]);\n\n// Output of the market value for the last low point\nPrint(\nThe last low of the ZigZag indicator was at \n + ZigZag(DeviationType.Percent, 1, true).ZigZagLow[0]);",

The APZ, which is particularly useful in non-trending, choppy markets, was developed with the aim of helping traders to find potential turning points in the markets. The APZ is based on a short-term, double-smoothed EMA that reacts rapidly to price changes with reduced lag. It works in the following way: the bands create a channel that envelopes the average price and tracks price changes. If the price crosses over the upper band of the zone, this creates an opportunity for the trader to trade a reversal. For the lower band, the reverse is true.",

Its name is derived from the Sanskrit \u201cdawn\u2019s early light\u201d. Chande used this name to signify the indicators\u2019 purpose of revealing the start of a new trend. These indicators measure the number of periods since the last time the price recorded an x-day high or low. There are two distinct indicators: the Aroon-Up and Aroon-Down, whereby a 50-day Aroon-Up measures the number of days since a 50-day high, and a 50-day Aroon-Down measures the days since a 50-day low. This makes the Aroon indicators significantly different from the usual momentum oscillators, which concentrate on price in relation to time. What makes Aroon indicators unique is that they focus on time in relation to price. Aroon indicators can be used to detect emerging trends, identify consolidations, anticipate reversals and define correction periods.",

At its most basic, the bulls have the edge when Aroon-Up is above 50 and Aroon-Down is below 50. This indicates a greater propensity for new x-day highs than lows. The converse is true for a downtrend. The bears have the edge when Aroon-Up is below 50 and Aroon-Down is above 50.  A surge to 100 indicates that a trend may be emerging. This can be confirmed with a decline in the other Aroon indicator. For example, a move to 100 in Aroon-Up combined with a decline below 30 in Aroon-Down shows upside strength. Consistently high readings mean prices are regularly hitting new highs or new lows for the specified period. Prices are moving consistently higher when Aroon-Up remains in the 70-100 range for an extended period. Conversely, consistently low readings indicate that prices are seldom hitting new highs or lows. Prices are NOT moving lower when Aroon-Down remains in the 0-30 range for an extended period. This does not mean prices are moving higher though. For that we need to check Aroon-Up.",

            "text": "The Average True Range (ATR), which was developed by J. Welles Wilder, is an indicator that measures volatility. As is true for most of his indicators, Wilder designed the ATR with commodities and daily prices in mind. Commodities are often more volatile than stocks, and frequently experience gaps and limit moves, which happen when a commodity opens up or down its maximum allowed move for the session. A volatility formula that was based on the high-low range only would be unable to capture volatility from gap or limit moves. Wilder, therefore, developed the Average True Range to capture this \"missing\" volatility. Keep in mind that ATR does not provide an indication of price direction, but merely volatility.  The ATR is featured in Wilder\u2019s 1978 book, New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems, which also goes into detail about the Parabolic SAR, RSI and the Directional Movement Concept (ADX). Despite having been developed before the computer age, Wilder's indicators are equally functional today and remain extremely popular.  The starting point for Wilder was a concept called  True Range (TR) , which is defined as the greatest of the following:\n-   Method 1: current high minus the current low\n-   Method 2: current high minus the previous close (absolute value)\n-   Method 3: current Low minus the previous close (absolute value)  Absolute values are used for ensuring positive numbers, since Wilder was interested in measuring the distance between two points, not the direction. If the current period's high is above the prior period's high and the low is below the prior period's low, then the current period's high-low range will be used as the True Range. This is an outside day that would use method 1 to calculate the TR, and is quite straightforward. Methods 2 and 3 are used whenever there is a gap or inside day. A gap occurs when the previous close is greater than the current high (indicating a potential gap down or limit move) or the previous close is lower than the current low (indicating a potential gap up or limit move). The image below shows examples of when methods 2 and 3 are appropriate.",

            "text": "Bollinger Bands\u00ae, which were developed by John Bollinger, are volatility bands that are placed above and below a moving average. The volatility is based on the standard deviation, which fluctuates as volatility increases and decreases. An increase in volatility causes the bands to automatically widen, and a decrease in volatility causes them to automatically narrow. The Bollinger Bands\u2019 dynamic nature means that they can also be used on different securities with the standard settings. When it comes to signals, Bollinger Bands can be used to identify M-Tops and W-Bottoms, or for determining a trend\u2019s strength.  Bollinger Bands are made up of a middle band with two outer bands.  The middle band is a simple moving average that is normally set to 20 periods. The reason a simple moving average is used is that the standard deviation formula also uses a simple moving average. The look-back period for the standard deviation is the same as for the simple moving average. The outer bands are generally set 2 standard deviations above and below the middle band, but settings can be adjusted to suit the characteristics of specific securities or trading styles. Bollinger recommends making small, incremental adjustments to the standard deviation multiplier. Changing the number of periods for the moving average also has an effect on the number of periods used to calculate the standard deviation, which is why only small adjustments are required for the standard deviation multiplier. An increase in the moving average period would also automatically increase the number of periods used for calculating the standard deviation, as well as warranting an increase in the standard deviation multiplier. With a 20-day SMA and 20-day Standard Deviation, the standard deviation multiplier is set at 2. Bollinger recommends increasing the standard deviation multiplier to 2.1 for a 50-period SMA and decreasing the standard deviation multiplier to 1.9 for a 10-period SMA. Bollinger Bands reflect direction with the 20-period SMA and volatility with the upper/lower bands . This means that they can be used to determine whether prices are relatively high or low. Bollinger maintains that the bands should contain 88-89% of price action, rendering a move outside the bands very significant. Technically, prices are relatively high when above the upper band and relatively low when below the lower band. However, relatively high should not be seen as bearish or as a sell signal. Likewise, relatively low should not be regarded as bullish or as a buy signal, since prices are high or low for a reason. As with other indicators, Bollinger Bands are not designed to be used as a stand-alone tool. Traders should combine Bollinger Bands with basic trend analysis and other indicators to confirm a trend.  The calculation is performed in the following manner:  Upper band = middle band + 2 standard deviations\nMiddle band = average of 20 periods\nLower band = middle period \u2013 2 standard deviations  More information can be found here:  BollingerMTF ,  Bollinger Percent %B ,  Bollinger Bands Width",

            "text": "Bollinger %b is an important indicator that is derived from John Bollinger's original Bollinger Bands indicator. %b represents the location of the most recent close price in relation to the Bollinger Bands as well as to what degree it is above or below any of the bands. The Bollinger Percent B equation can be constructed in the following way: Percent B = ((Close - Bollinger Lower Band) / (Bollinger Upper Band - Bollinger Lower Band)) * 100. If the close price is the same as the upper Bollinger Band, %b will be 100 (percent). If the close price is the same as the lower Bollinger Band, %b will be 0.0 (percent). A %b value of 50 indicates that the close price is equal to the middle Bollinger Band. What is more, readings above 100 and below 0 show that the close price is outside of the Bollinger Bands by a corresponding percentage of the Bollinger Bandwidth. A %b value of 125 means that the close price is above the upper Bollinger Band by 25% of the Bandwidth, while a %b value of -25 means that the close price is below the lower Bollinger Band by 25% of the Bandwidth.  See  Bollinger Bands ,  BBWidth  An additional application: normalizing indicators  Bollinger bands, and therefore the %b indicator, can be applied not only to the prices of stocks, futures etc., but also to time series with fundamental data, volume data and other indicators. This is particularly interesting when you need to know whether a value is relatively high or low \u2013 in this case, the %b indicator offers you a different perspective. If you wish to find out whether the volume of a stock is exceedingly high or low, you can simply apply it to the volume data. John Bollinger regards the application of the %b onto other indicators as one of the most important aspects of the indicator. If you wish to normalize an indicator with %b, it is important to first calculate the indicator (e.g. the RSI) with the help of the %b for the calculation of the indicator instead of the price data. The application of the %b essentially works in the same way as the application of Bollinger bands onto the indicator itself. The intersection points between the bands and the indicators will therefore be 1 and 0. In principle, the relative position of the original indicator is displayed in relation to its upper and lower bands. This means that the boundaries of the original indicator will be removed. John Bollinger himself wrote: \u201cYou\u2019re defining a high or low point on a relative basis, this may allow you to gain a deeper insight and understanding not provided by traditional indicators and guidelines.\u201d John Bollinger provides several parameters for the %b calculation, such as 40-day periods and a factor of 2.0 for a 9-day RSI, and a 50-day period with a factor of 2.1 for the calculation of %b.

In general, what CCI does is to measure the current price level relative to an average price level over a specified period of time. When prices are well above their average, CCI is relatively high.

If the price falls too far, this can signify a false breakout.

Each new box is created based on a previous box, depicting a \u201cstair\u201d formation.\nIf a new high is not formed after three consecutive days, then the high is labeled as the upper boundary.

The extreme zones in the developed stochastics are the same as for the original stochastics. The upper extreme area is marked at 80, and the lower extreme zone at 20 - these values cannot be changed.

The indicator was developed by the journalist Goichi Hosoda, and published in his 1969 book.

This indicator shares similarities with Bollinger Bands, where the bands are set using the standard deviation. Here, instead of using the standard deviation, Keltner Channels use the Average True Range (ATR) to set the channel distance. Typically, the channels are set two Average True Range values above and two ATRs below the 20-day EMA. The EMA determines the direction and the Average True Range dictates the channel width. Keltner Channels form a trend-following indicator that is applied with the aim of identifying reversals with channel breakouts and channel direction. The channels can also be used to spot overbought and oversold levels when the trend is flat.\nIn his 1960 book,  How to Make Money in Commodities,  Chester Keltner featured the \"Ten-Day Moving Average Trading Rule,\" credited as the original version of Keltner Channels. This version started off with a 10-day SMA of the typical price {(H+L+C)/3)} as the center line. The 10-day SMA of the high-low range was added and subtracted to set the upper and lower channel lines respectively. Linda Bradford Raschke then brought in the more recent version of Keltner Channels in the 1980s. Similarly to Bollinger Bands, this new version made use of a volatility-based indicator, Average True Range (ATR), to set channel width.\nMiddle line = 20-day exponential moving average\nUpper channel line: 20-day EMA + (2x ATR(10))\nLower channel line: 20-day EMA \u2013 (2xATR(10))",

Therefore, moves above or below the channel lines warrant attention because they are relatively rare. Trends often start with strong moves in one direction or another. A surge above the upper channel line shows extraordinary strength, while a plunge below the lower channel line shows extraordinary weakness. Such strong moves can signal the end of one trend and the beginning of another.  With an exponential\u00a0 moving average ,  average \u00a0as their foundation, the Keltner Channels are a trend-following indicator. As with moving averages and trend-following indicators, Keltner Channels lag price action. The direction of the moving average dictates the direction of the channel. In general, a downtrend is present when the channel moves lower, while an uptrend exists when the channel moves higher. The trend is flat when the channel moves sideways.  A channel upturn and break above the upper trend line can signal the start of an uptrend. A channel downturn and break below the lower trend line can signal the start a downtrend. Sometimes a strong trend does not take hold after a channel breakout and prices oscillate between the channel lines. Such trading ranges are marked by a relatively flat moving average. The channel boundaries can then be used to identify overbought and oversold levels for trading purposes.",

The indicator compares the influent and effluent volume of an instrument with its price movements, and is outputted as an oscillator. A signal line (13-period moving average) is used for generating signals. Divergences in the KlingerVolumeOscillator in comparison to the price movement can also be used for entry and exit decisions.

The MACD makes two trend-following indicators, moving averages, average, become a momentum oscillator by subtracting the longer moving average from the shorter moving average. As a result of this, the MACD offers great advantages: trend following and momentum. The MACD moves above and below the zero line as the moving averages converge, cross and diverge again. Signal line crossovers, centerline crossovers and divergences are things that traders can keep an eye out for to generate signals. Since the MACD is unbounded, it is not especially useful for identifying overbought or oversold levels. The MACD line is the 12-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) minus the 26-day EMA, and closing prices are used for these moving averages. A 9-day EMA of the MACD line is plotted with the indicator acting as a signal line and identifying turns. The MACD histogram shows the difference between the MACD and its 9-day EMA, i.e. the signal line. When the MACD line is above its signal line, the histogram is positive, and vice versa when the MACD line is below its signal line.  The typical settings used with the MACD are the values 12, 26 and 9. However, other values can also be used depending on the trading style and goals in mind.",

            "text": "As its name implies, the MACD is all about the convergence and divergence of the two moving averages. Convergence occurs when the moving averages move towards each other. Divergence occurs when the moving averages move away from each other. The shorter moving average (12-day) is faster and responsible for most MACD movements. The longer moving average (26-day) is slower and less reactive to price changes in the underlying security.  The MACD line oscillates above and below the zero line, which is also known as the centerline. These crossovers signal that the 12-day EMA has crossed the 26-day EMA. The direction, of course, depends on the direction of the moving average cross. Positive MACD indicates that the 12-day EMA is above the 26-day EMA. Positive values increase as the shorter EMA diverges further from the longer EMA.\u00a0This means upside momentum is increasing.\u00a0Negative MACD values indicate that the 12-day EMA is below the 26-day EMA. Negative values increase as the shorter EMA diverges further below the longer EMA.\u00a0This means downside\u00a0 momentum \u00a0is increasing. Signal line crossovers are the most common MACD signals. The signal line is a 9-day EMA of the MACD line. As a moving average of the indicator, it trails the MACD and makes it easier to spot MACD turns. A bullish crossover occurs when the MACD turns up and crosses above the signal line. A bearish crossover occurs when the MACD turns down and crosses below the signal line. Crossovers can last a few days or a few weeks, it all depends on the strength of the move.  Due diligence is required before relying on these common signals. Signal line crossovers at positive or negative extremes should be viewed with caution. Even though the MACD does not have upper and lower limits, chartists can estimate historical extremes with a simple visual assessment. It takes a strong move in the underlying security to push momentum to an extreme. Even though the move may continue, momentum is likely to slow and this will usually produce a signal line crossover at the extremities. Volatility in the underlying security can also increase the number of crossovers.",

The moving average forms the base for this indicator, and can be a either simple or exponential moving average. Each MA envelope is set the same percentage above or below the moving average, thereby creating parallel bands that follow price action. Moving Average Envelopes can be used as a trend-following indicator with a moving average as the base. But this indicator is not limited to just trend following: the envelopes can also be used for spotting overbought and oversold levels when the trend is relatively flat.  Indicators based on channels, bands and envelopes are intended to encompass most price action, which is why moves above or below the envelopes deserve attention. Trends often start with sharp moves in one direction \u2013 a surge above the upper envelope shows extraordinary strength, while a dive below the lower envelope exhibits extraordinary weakness. Strong moves such as these can signal the end of one trend and the start of another.  With a  moving average  as the foundation, Moving Average Envelopes are a trend-following indicator. As with moving averages, the envelopes lag price action. The direction of the moving average dictates the direction of the channel, so generally, when the channel moves lower, a downtrend exists, and when the channel goes higher, an uptrend is present. When the channel moves sideways, this signifies that the trend is flat.  Occasionally, it happens that a strong trend does not establish itself after an envelope break, and prices move into a trading range. Trading ranges such as these are characterized by a relatively flat moving average. These envelopes can then be used to spot overbought and oversold levels. A move above the upper envelope shows an overbought situation; a move below the lower envelope signals an oversold situation.",

The smaller the period interval, the quicker the reaction time will be, but as a consequence, the smoothing effect will also be diminished. The opposite is true when increasing the period selection. The most popular choices are: 38, 50, 100 and 200 days.

When two arithmetic averages are used, whereby one is a short-term and the other a long-term, more interesting signals can be generated. One such application can be seen with Richard Donchian\u2019s methodologies, such as using the 5 and 20-day averages.\nThe Double Crossover Method generates signals in the following way:  If the short-term average crosses the long-term average from below, this is called a Golden Cross, and a buy signal is generated. Higher trading volume reinforces the quality of the signal. The long-term average works as a support line in an uptrend.  If the short-term average crosses the long-term average from above, this is called a Death Cross. It generates a sell signal. Higher trading volume reinforces the signal quality. In a downtrend, the long-term average functions as a resistance line.  Crossing of three moving averages  Another method is to use three moving averages (Triple Crossover Method). This method was presented by R.C Allen, who used the 4, 9, and 18-day averages and suggested that a trend change is hinted at when the 4MA crosses the 9MA from bottom to top. An entry is only recommended when all lines are above the 18-day period. An exit is initiated when the 4-day MA moves below the 9-day MA.\n(Source: VTAD)",

It is called \u201cmoving\u201d because to establish an average, the oldest value is always sacrificed to make space for the new incoming price change. Fundamentally speaking, the period length influences the intensity of the smoothing. Shorter periods (such as 10 days) will mean that the indicator follows the price changes quite closely.\nThe SMA has a few disadvantages, which is why several adaptations of this indicator have been developed in the last few years. One of the biggest disadvantages is the fact that the indicator tends to lag, and the equal weighting for all data inputs across time intervals.\nYou can find more general interpretations and meanings here:  Moving Averages .",

A rising OBV reflects positive volume pressure that can lead to higher prices. Conversely, falling OBV reflects negative volume pressure that can foreshadow lower prices. Granville noted in his research that OBV would often move before price. Expect prices to move higher if OBV is rising while prices are either flat or moving down. Expect prices to move lower if OBV is falling while prices are either flat or moving up.  The absolute value of OBV is not important. Chartists should instead focus on the characteristics of the OBV line. First define the trend for OBV. Second, determine if the current trend matches the trend for the underlying security. Third, look for potential support or resistance levels. Once broken, the trend for OBV will change and these breaks can be used to generate signals. Also notice that OBV is based on closing prices. Therefore, closing prices should be considered when looking for divergences or support/resistance breaks. And finally, volume spikes can sometimes throw off the indicator by causing a sharp move that will require a settling period. (Source: Stockcharts.com)",

Point 2 is often situated at the high of a bar, and point 3 at the low of the same bar. Depending on the timeframe and fluctuation range, T0 and T1 can be fused into one.  The indicator determines the selected timeframe of the chart, and then labels all trends and trend sizes accordingly. When there is low volatility, trend recognition is more sensitive, and the vice versa for higher volatility. The P123\u2019s adaptive methods make for a balanced recognition of trend sizes.  Important tip:  In some cases, the large trend (T0) cannot be seen with the naked eye, which may be due to the fact that not enough candles are visible within the chart.

Wilder named this the \"Parabolic Time/Price System.\" SAR signifies \"stop and reverse,\" which is the name of the actual indicator used in his system, where  SAR trails price as the trend extends over time . When prices are rising, the indicator is below them, and when prices are falling, it is above them. Therefore the indicator stops and reverses when the price trend reverses and breaks either above or below the indicator.  Wilder used his new book, New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems, to introduce the Parabolic Time/Price System in 1978. The book also discusses RSI, Average True Range, and the Directional Movement Concept (ADX). Although they were created before the computer age, Wilder's indicators function equally well today and have a high reputation.  SAR follows the price, and can be considered a trend-following indicator. If a downtrend reverses and starts up, SAR follows the prices just like a trailing stop. This stop continues to rise so long as the uptrend remains intact, which means that the SAR never decreases in an uptrend and is always protecting profits as prices move forwards. Once the price stops rising and reverses below SAR, a downtrend starts and SAR is above the price. SAR follows prices lower like a trailing stop, as mentioned before. The stop continuously falls as long as the downtrend continues to exist. Due to the fact that SAR never rises in a downtrend, it always protects profits on short positions.",

In the beginning, the price zones were calculated using the price developments of the last 2-3 years. Nowadays, however, the practical concept of pivot points is taken from the calculation of price zones in the daily chart, using the previous day\u2019s periods as the basis. The goal hereby is to determine price levels that one could use as potential resistance zones (R1..R3) or support zones (S1..S3). The following methods can be used to calculate the indicator: Classic, Floor, Woodie, Camarilla, Fibonacci. The Classic and Floor methods are often wrongly named within literature, which is why in AgenaTrader you will find that the Classic method is labeled as \u201cFloor\u201d and vice versa. The indicator displays the pivot points for intraday charts, and the parameter \u201cShowPrices\u201d allows you to display the price on the levels. The parameter \u201cDaysBack\u201d allows you to set the number of periods in the past that should be used for the calculation. The line coloring can be defined manually",

The indicator, which originates from a starting value, continues to proceed in one direction until the market changes direction, combined with rising volatility. This causes the indicator to adjust its starting value to match that of the counter-direction. The indicator is programmed in such a way that nothing but the trend direction can bring about a change.

The buy signal is created when the price breaches that last high.

            "text": "Larry Williams developed the Williams %R. It is a momentum indicator, and is the inverse of the Fast Stochastic Oscillator. Williams %R, which is also called simply %R, reflects the level of the close relative to the highest high for the look-back period. The Stochastic Oscillator, on the other hand, reflects the level of the close relative to the lowest low. %R multiplies the raw value by -100 as a means of correcting for the inversion. This means that the Fast Stochastic Oscillator and Williams %R actually produce the exact same lines, with different scaling. The Williams %R fluctuates between 0 and -100. Values between 0 to -20 are deemed overbought, and values from -80 to -100 are seen as oversold. Naturally, signals taken from the Stochastic Oscillator can also be applied to Williams %R.",

            "text": "As with the Stochastic Oscillator, Williams %R reflects the level of the close relative to the high-low range over a given period of time. Assume that the highest high equals 110, the lowest low equals 100 and the close equals 108. The high-low range is 10 (110 - 100), which is the denominator in the %R formula. The highest high less the close equals 2 (110 - 108), which is the numerator. 2 divided by 10 equals 0.20. Multiply this number by -100 to get -20 for %R. Williams %R would equal -30 if the close was 103 (0.30 x -100).  The centerline, -50, is an important level to watch. Williams %R moves between 0 and -100, which makes -50 the midpoint. Think of it as the 50 yard line in football. The offense has a higher chance of scoring when it crosses the 50 yard line. The defense has an edge as long as it prevents the offense from crossing the 50 yard line. A Williams %R cross above -50 signals that prices are trading in the upper half of their high-low range for the given look-back period. This suggests that the cup is half full. Conversely, a cross below -50 means prices are trading in the bottom half of the given look-back period. This suggests that the cup is half empty.  Low readings (below -80) indicate that the price is near its low for the given time period. High readings (above -20) indicate that the price is near its high for the given time period.",

When the volume bars are colored red, we are dealing with a short wave; green volume bars indicate a long wave.   Using the parameter \u201cMedianPeriod\u201d you can select how sensitively the indicator should determine the individual price waves. The smaller the value, the larger the price waves that the indicator calculates.   The parameter Poles serves to fine-tune the display of the volume waves; you can select a parameter between 1-4. Changing this value usually causes only imperceptible changes.",
