The APZ is a volatility-based indicator that appears as a set of bands placed over a price chart. Especially useful in non-trending, choppy markets, the APZ was created to help traders find potential turning points in the markets. The APZ is based on a short-term double-smoothed exponential moving average that reacts quickly to price changes with reduced lag. The bands form a channel that surrounds the average price and tracks the price changes. If the price crosses the upper band of the zone then this will present you with an opportunity to trade a reversal. The opposite is true for the lower band.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe bigger the price movement, the greater the distance between the upper and lower band will be. The smaller the price movement, the smaller the distance between the bands. More widely spaced bands will indicate increased instability and volatility, whereas closely tuned bands will display reduced volatility. If the price action breaks through the upper or lower band then the APZ will tend to return to its statistical average. This will lead to trading opportunities where the market may try to compensate for imbalances. If the price overshoots the bands for example, as mentioned in the description, then this will present you with a trading opportunity in the opposite direction.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nhttp://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/10/adaptive-price-zone-indicator-explained.asp\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nAPZ\n(\ndouble\n barPct, \nint\n period)\n\n\nAPZ\n(IDataSeries input, \ndouble\n barPct, \nint\n period)\n\n\nUpper Band\n\n\nAPZ\n(\ndouble\n barPct, \nint\n period).Upper[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nAPZ\n(IDataSeries input, \ndouble\n barPct, \nint\n period).Upper[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nLower Band\n\n\nAPZ\n(\ndouble\n barPct, \nint\n period).Lower[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nAPZ\n(IDataSeries input, \ndouble\n barPct, \nint\n period).Lower[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using the method with an index (e.g. \nAPZ\n(2, 20)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be outputted for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\nbarPct Standard deviation\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculation\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output for the current values for the upper and lower band of a 20-period APZ\n\n\nPrint\n(\"Value for the upper APZ band : \" + \nAPZ\n(2, 20).Upper[0]);\n\n\nPrint\n(\"Value for the lower APZ band: \" + \nAPZ\n(2, 20).Lower[0]);\n\n\nAroon\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nDeveloped by Tushar Chande in 1995, Aroon is an indicator system that determines whether a stock is trending or not and how strong the trend is. \"Aroon\" means \"Dawn's Early Light\" in Sanskrit. Chande chose this name because the indicators are designed to reveal the beginning of a new trend. The Aroon indicators measure the number of periods since the price recorded an x-day high or low. There are two separate indicators: Aroon-Up and Aroon-Down. A 25-day Aroon-Up measures the number of days since a 25-day high. A 25-day Aroon-Down measures the number of days since a 25-day low. In this sense, the Aroon indicators are quite different from typical\u00a0\nmomentum oscillators\n, which focus on price relative to time. Aroon is unique because it focuses on time relative to price. Chartists can use the Aroon indicators to spot emerging trends, identify consolidations, define correction periods and anticipate reversals. \n(Source: Stockcharts.com)\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe Aroon indicators fluctuate above/below a centerline (50) and are bound between 0 and 100. These three levels are important for interpretation. At its most basic, the bulls have the edge when Aroon-Up is above 50 and Aroon-Down is below 50. This indicates a greater propensity for new x-day highs than lows. The converse is true for a downtrend. The bears have the edge when Aroon-Up is below 50 and Aroon-Down is above 50.\n\n\nA surge to 100 indicates that a trend may be emerging. This can be confirmed with a decline in the other Aroon indicator. For example, a move to 100 in Aroon-Up combined with a decline below 30 in Aroon-Down shows upside strength. Consistently high readings mean prices are regularly hitting new highs or new lows for the specified period. Prices are moving consistently higher when Aroon-Up remains in the 70-100 range for an extended period. Conversely, consistently low readings indicate that prices are seldom hitting new highs or lows. Prices are NOT moving lower when Aroon-Down remains in the 0-30 range for an extended period. This does not mean prices are moving higher though. For that we need to check Aroon-Up.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nVTAD: [\nhttp://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:aroon\n]\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nAroon\n(\nint\n period)\n\n\nAroon\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n period)\n\n\n//For the upper value\n\n\nAroon\n(\nint\n period).Up[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nAroon\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n period).Up[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\n//For the lower value\n\n\nAroon\n(\nint\n period).Down[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nAroon\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n period).Down[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nAroon\n(20)[\nint\n barsAgo] ) the value of the indicator will be displayed for the last referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars taken into consideration when calculating the values\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output of the current up or down values for the 20 period Aroon\n\n\nPrint\n(\"Current value for Aroon Up is : \" + \nAroon\n(20).Up[0]);\n\n\nPrint\n(\"Current value for Aroon Down is: \" + \nAroon\n(20).Down[0]);\n\n\nAroon Oscillator\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Aroon Oscillator is calculated by subtracting the Aroon Down from the Aroon Up. These two indicators are usually plotted together for easy comparison, but chartists can also view the difference of these two indicators with the Aroon Oscillator. This indicator fluctuates between -100 and +100 with zero as the middle line. A bullish trend bias is present when the oscillator is positive, while a bearish trend bias exists when the oscillator is negative. Chartists can also expand the bull-bear threshold to identify stronger signals.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe Aroon Oscillator is ideally used as a trend filter and trend strength indicator.

Wilder designed ADX with commodities and daily prices in mind, but these indicators can also be applied to stocks. The Average Directional Index (ADX) measures trend strength without regard to trend direction. The other two indicators, Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI), complement ADX by defining trend direction. Used together, chartists can determine both the\u00a0\ndirection\n\u00a0and \nstrength\n\u00a0of the trend.\n\n\nWilder features the Directional Movement indicators in his 1978 book,\u00a0\nNew Concepts in Technical Trading Systems\n. This book also includes details on Average True Range (ATR), the Parabolic SAR system and\u00a0\nRSI\n. Despite being developed before the computer age, Wilder's indicators are incredibly detailed in their calculation and have stood the test of time.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe Average Directional Index (ADX) is used to measure the strength or weakness of a trend, not the actual direction. Directional movement is defined by +DI and -DI. In general, the bulls have the edge when +DI is greater than -DI, while the bears have the edge when -DI is greater. Crosses of these directional indicators can be combined with ADX for a complete trading system.\n\n\nIt should be kept in mind that Wilder was a commodity and currency trader. The examples in his books are based on these instruments, not stocks. This does not mean his indicators cannot be used with stocks. Some stocks have price characteristics similar to commodities, which tend to be more volatile with short and strong trends. Stocks with low volatility may not generate signals based on Wilder's parameters. Chartists will likely need to adjust the indicator settings or the signal parameters according to the characteristics of the security.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nWikipedia: [\nhttp://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_Directional_Movement_Index\n]\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nADX\n(\nint\n period)\n\n\nADX\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n period)\n\n\nADX\n(\nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nADX\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nADX\n(20)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be outputted for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculation\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output of the current value of a 20 period ADX\n\n\nPrint\n(\"Value of the ADX: \" + \nADX\n(20)[0]);\n\n\nAverage Directional Movement Rating (ADXR)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis is the ADX Indicator plus the ADX of n days ago divided by 2.\n(Current ADX + ADX n days ago) / 2\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe oscillator moves along a guiding line that typically has a value of 20.

Welles Wilder, the Average True Range (ATR) is an indicator that measures\u00a0\nvolatility\n. As with most of his indicators, Wilder designed ATR with commodities and daily prices in mind. Commodities are frequently more volatile than stocks. They are often subject to gaps and limit moves, which occur when a commodity opens up or down its maximum allowed move for the session. A volatility formula based only on the high-low range would fail to capture volatility from gap or limit moves. Wilder created Average True Range to capture this \"missing\" volatility. It is important to remember that ATR does not provide an indication of price direction, just volatility.\n\n\nWilder features ATR in his 1978 book,\u00a0\nNew Concepts in Technical Trading Systems\n. This book also includes the Parabolic SAR, RSI and the Directional Movement Concept (ADX). Despite being developed before the computer age, Wilder's indicators have stood the test of time and remain extremely popular.\n\n\nWilder started with a concept called\u00a0\nTrue Range (TR)\n, which is defined as the greatest of the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod 1: current high minus the current low\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod 2: current high minus the previous close (absolute value)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod 3: current Low minus the previous close (absolute value)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolute values are used to ensure positive numbers. After all, Wilder was interested in measuring the distance between two points, not the direction. If the current period's high is above the prior period's high and the low is below the prior period's low, then the current period's high-low range will be used as the True Range. This is an outside day that would use method 1 to calculate the TR. This is pretty straightforward. Methods 2 and 3 are used when there is a gap or an inside day. A gap occurs when the previous close is greater than the current high (signaling a potential gap down or limit move) or the previous close is lower than the current low (signaling a potential gap up or limit move). The image below shows examples of when methods 2 and 3 are appropriate.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nVTAD: [\nhttp://vtadwiki.vtad.de/index.php/Average_True_Range\n]\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nATR\n(\nint\n period)\n\n\nATR\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n period)\n\n\nATR\n(\nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nATR\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nATR\n(14)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be outputted for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculation\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output of the current value of a 14 period ATR\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The current ATR value is: \" + \nATR\n(14)[0]);\n\n\nBalance of Power (BOP)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Balance of Power indicator was developed by Igor Livshin in August 2001.

Volatility is based on the\u00a0\nstandard deviation\n, which changes as volatility increases and decreases. The bands automatically widen when volatility increases and narrow when volatility decreases. This dynamic nature of Bollinger Bands also means they can be used on different securities with the standard settings. For signals, Bollinger Bands can be used to identify M-Tops and W-Bottoms or to determine the strength of the trend.\n\n\nBollinger Bands consist of a middle band with two outer bands.\n\u00a0The middle band is a\u00a0simple moving average\u00a0that is usually set at 20 periods. A simple moving average is used because the standard deviation formula also uses a simple moving average. The look-back period for the standard deviation is the same as for the simple moving average. The outer bands are usually set 2 standard deviations above and below the middle band. Settings can be adjusted to suit the characteristics of particular securities or trading styles. Bollinger recommends making small incremental adjustments to the standard deviation multiplier. Changing the number of periods for the moving average also affects the number of periods used to calculate the standard deviation. Therefore, only small adjustments are required for the standard deviation\u00a0\nmultiplier\n. An increase in the moving average period would automatically increase the number of periods used to calculate the standard deviation and would also warrant an increase in the standard deviation\u00a0\nmultiplier\n. With a 20-day SMA and 20-day Standard Deviation, the standard deviation multiplier is set at 2. Bollinger suggests increasing the standard deviation multiplier to 2.1 for a 50-period SMA and decreasing the standard deviation multiplier to 1.9 for a 10-period SMA.\n\n\nBollinger Bands reflect direction with the 20-period SMA and volatility with the upper/lower bands. As such, they can be used to determine if prices are relatively high or low.\u00a0\nAccording to Bollinger, the bands should contain 88-89% of price action, which makes a move outside the bands significant.\n\u00a0Technically, prices are relatively high when above the upper band and relatively low when below the lower band. However, relatively high should not be regarded as bearish or as a sell signal. Likewise, relatively low should not be considered bullish or as a buy signal. Prices are high or low for a reason. As with other indicators, Bollinger Bands are not meant to be used as a stand-alone tool. Chartists should combine Bollinger Bands with basic trend analysis and other indicators for confirmation. (Source: Stockcharts)\n\n\nThe calculation is performed in the following manner:\n\n\nUpper band = middle band + 2 standard deviations\nMiddle band = average of 20 periods\nLower band = middle period \u2013 2 standard deviations\n\n\nMore information can be found here: \nBollingerMTF\n, \nBollinger Percent %B\n, \nBollinger Bands Width\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nVTAD: [\nhttp://vtadwiki.vtad.de/index.php/Bollinger_B%C3%A4nder\n]\n\n\nBook \"Technische Indikatoren - simplified\" by Oliver Paesler (German only)\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nBollinger\n(\ndouble\n numStdDev, \nint\n period)\n\n\nBollinger\n(IDataSeries input, \ndouble\n numStdDev, \nint\n period)\n\n\nFor the upper band\n\n\nBollinger\n(\ndouble\n numStdDev, \nint\n period).Upper[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nBollinger\n(IDataSeries input, \ndouble\n numStdDev, \nint\n period).Upper[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nFor the lower band\n\n\nBollinger\n(\ndouble\n numStdDev, \nint\n period).Lower[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nBollinger\n(IDataSeries input, \ndouble\n numStdDev, \nint\n period).Lower[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nBollinger\n(2, 20)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be displayed for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nnumStdDev Standard deviation\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculation\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output of the value for the upper Bollinger Band\n\n\nPrint\n(\"Value of the upper band: \" + \nBollinger\n(2, 20).Upper[0]);\n\n\n//Middle band\n\n\nPrint\n(\"Value of the middle band: \" + \nBollinger\n(2, 20)[0]);\n\n\n//Lower band\n\n\nPrint\n(\"Value of the lower band: \" + \nBollinger\n(2, 20).Lower[0]);\n\n\nBollinger Percent B (%b)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nBollinger %b\u00a0is an important indicator derived from John Bollinger's original Bollinger Bands indicator. %b depicts the location of the most recent close price in relation to the Bollinger Bands as well as to what degree it is above or below any of the bands.\nThe\u00a0Bollinger Percent B\u00a0equation can be constructed as:\nPercent B = ((Close - Bollinger Lower Band) / (Bollinger Upper Band - Bollinger Lower Band))*100\nIf the close price is equal to the upper Bollinger Band,\u00a0%b\u00a0will be 100 (percent). If the close price is equal to the lower Bollinger Band,\u00a0%b\u00a0will be 0.0 (percent). A\u00a0%b\u00a0value of 50 means the close price is equal to the middle Bollinger Band.\nFurthermore, readings above 100 and below 0 indicate that the close price is outside of the Bollinger Bands by a corresponding percentage of the Bollinger Bandwidth. A\u00a0%b\u00a0value of 125 means that the close price is above the upper Bollinger Band by 25% of the Bandwidth. A\u00a0%b\u00a0value of -25 means that the close price is below the lower Bollinger Band by 25% of the Bandwidth.\n\n\nSee \nBollinger Bands\n, \nBBWidth\n\n\nAn additional application: normalizing indicators\n\n\nBollinger bands and thus the %b indicator can be applied not only to the prices of stocks, futures etc. but also to time series with fundamental data, volume data and other indicators. This is especially interesting when you need to know if a value is relatively high or low; in this case, the %b indicator will offer you a different perspective. If you want to know whether the volume of a stock is exceedingly high or low you can simply apply it to the volume data.\nJohn Bollinger sees the application of the %b onto other indicators as one of the most important aspects of the indicator. If you want to normalize an indicator with %b, it is important to first calculate the indicator (e.g. the RSI) using the %b for the calculation of the indicator instead of the price data. The application of the %b essentially unfolds in the same manner as the application of Bollinger bands onto the indicator itself. The intersection points between the bands and the indicators will thus be 1 and 0. Essentially, the relative position of the original indicator will be displayed in relation to its upper and lower bands. Thus the boundaries of the original indicator will be removed.\nJohn Bollinger himself wrote that: \u201cYou\u2019re defining a high or low point on a relative basis, this may allow you to gain a deeper insight and understanding not provided by traditional indicators and guidelines.\u201d\nJohn Bollinger provides several parameters for the %b calculation, such as 40-day periods and a factor of 2.0 for a 9-day RSI, and a 50-day period with a factor of 2.1 for the calculation of %b.\n\n\n(Sources: Oliver Paesler: \"Technische Indikatoren - simplified\" and John Bollinger: \"Bollinger B\u00e4nder\")\n\n\n(Source: \ntradesignalonline\n)\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nVTAD: [\nhttp://vtadwiki.vtad.de/index.php/Bollinger_B%C3%A4nder\n]\n\n\nBook \"Technische Indikatoren - simplified\" by Oliver Paesler (German only)\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nBollingerPercentB\n(\nint\n period, \ndouble\n numStdDev)\n\n\nBollingerPercentB\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n period, \ndouble\n numStdDev)\n\n\nBollingerPercentB\n(\nint\n period, \ndouble\n numStdDev) [\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nBollingerPercentB\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n period, \ndouble\n numStdDev)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nBollingerPercentB\n(20, 2)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be outputted for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculation\n\n\nnumStdDev Standard deviation\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output for the value of Bollinger %B\n\n\nPrint\n(\"Value of the Bollinger Percent B is: \" + \nBollingerPercentB\n(20, 2)[0]);\n\n\nBollinger Band Width (BBWidth)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nBollinger Band Width is an indicator derived from\u00a0Bollinger Bands. In his book, \nBollinger on Bollinger Bands\n, John Bollinger refers to Bollinger Band Width as one of two indicators that can be derived from Bollinger Bands. The other indicator is %B.\n\n\nBand Width measures the percentage difference between the upper band and the lower band. Band Width decreases as Bollinger Bands narrow and increases as Bollinger Bands widen. Because Bollinger Bands are based on the standard deviation, falling Band Width reflects decreasing volatility and rising Band Width reflects increasing volatility.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nJohn Bollinger uses the Band Width to recognize rising and falling trends. Most trends have their origins within sideway market movements that generally have a low volatility. If a breakout is accompanied by a sudden rise in the Band Width, this means that there is definite support for the move.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nVTAD: [\nhttp://vtadwiki.vtad.de/index.php/Bollinger_B%C3%A4nder\n]\n\n\nBook \"Technische Indikatoren - simplified\" by Oliver Paesler (German only)\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nBBWidth\n(\ndouble\n numStdDev, \nint\n period)\n\n\nBBWidth\n(IDataSeries input, \ndouble\n numStdDev, \nint\n period)\n\n\nBBWidth\n(\ndouble\n numStdDev, \nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nBBWidth\n(IDataSeries input, \ndouble\n numStdDev, \nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nFor the value of the upper Band Width\n\n\nBBWidth\n(\ndouble\n numStdDev, \nint\n period).BandWidth\n\n\nBBWidth\n(IDataSeries input, \ndouble\n numStdDev, \nint\n period).BandWidth\n\n\nBBWidth\n(\ndouble\n numStdDev, \nint\n period).BandWidth[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nBBWidth\n(IDataSeries input, \ndouble\n numStdDev, \nint\n period).BandWidth[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nFor the value of the trigger line (threshold)\n\n\nBBWidth\n(\ndouble\n numStdDev, \nint\n period).Threshold\n\n\nBBWidth\n(IDataSeries input, \ndouble\n numStdDev, \nint\n period).Threshold\n\n\nBBWidth\n(\ndouble\n numStdDev, \nint\n period).Threshold[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nBBWidth\n(IDataSeries input, \ndouble\n numStdDev, \nint\n period).Threshold[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using the method with an index (e.g. \nBBWidth\n(2, 20)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be outputted for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculation\n\n\nnumStdDev Standard deviation\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output for the values of Bollinger Band Width\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The value of the Bollinger Band Width is: \" + \nBBWidth\n(2, 20).BandWidth[0]);\n\n\n//Output for the values for the signal line\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The value of the signal line is: \" + \nBBWidth\n(2, 20).Threshold[0]);\n\n\nBollinger MTF (MultiTimeFrame)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis is the multi-timeframe version of the Bollinger Bands.

It is a volume indicator that attempts to answer the following question: Where does the money flow into? Into the stock = accumulation, and out of the stock = distribution. Obviously, this applies not only to stocks/shares but also to other instruments. Chaikin attempts to expand on and improve the On-Balance Volume created by Granville. With the CMF, the position of the closing price within the trading range is placed in relation to the volume. Basically, this means that the trading volume is multiplied by the price. The trading volume shows the amount of money that has \u201cflowed\u201d into the stock or has been \u201cremoved\u201d; the indicator merely displays whether it has been accumulated (buying pressure) or has been removed (distribution). (Source: VTAD)\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe CMF oscillates around the zero line and is shown in a separate window with an open scale. Should the CMF be located above the zero line, then it can be interpreted as accumulation. If higher highs are being created, then the buying pressure is increasing. The reverse is true for the selling pressure. The Chaikin Money Flow should always be used in combination with other methods of technical analysis.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nVTAD: [\nhttp://vtadwiki.vtad.de/index.php/Chaikin_Money_Flow\n]\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nChaikinMoneyFlow\n(\nint\n period)\n\n\nChaikinMoneyFlow\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n period)\n\n\nChaikinMoneyFlow\n(\nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nChaikinMoneyFlow\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nChaikinMoneyFlow\n(21)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be outputted for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculation\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output for the Money Flow value\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The Chaikin Money Flow value is: \" + \nChaikinMoneyFlow\n(21)[0]);\n\n\nChaikin Oscillator\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Chaikin Oscillator is a volume indicator that shows if new highs are accompanied by new volumes. The Chaikin Oscillator is a simple MACD applied to the accumulation/distribution line. What is calculated is the difference between a 3-day exponential moving average and a 10-day exponential smoothed average for the accumulation/distribution line.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe interpretation of the Chaikin Oscillator is similar to the principle of the accumulation/distribution.

It is implied that a widening range is associated with a higher volatility.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe indicator oscillates around the zero line and fluctuates between a scale of +100 to -100. It can be used on a daily chart as well as on a weekly or monthly chart. All values above the zero line represent rising volatility, and the gradient of the rise implies the seriousness of potential floors forming. The Chaikin Volatility is not specifically used to define exact signals, but is considered as more of an assisting tool in the trading system.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nChaikinVolatility\n(\nint\n fast, \nint\n slow)\n\n\nChaikinVolatility\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n fast, \nint\n slow)\n\n\nChaikinVolatility\n(\nint\n fast, \nint\n slow)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nChaikinVolatility\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n fast, \nint\n slow)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nChaikinVolatility\n(14)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be outputted for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Chaikin output for a period of 14\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The value of the Chaikin Volatility is: \" + \nChaikinVolatility\n(14)[0]);\n\n\nChande Momentum Oscillator (CMO)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe CMO is a technical momentum indicator invented by the technical analyst Tushar Chande. It is created by calculating the difference between the sum of all recent gains and the sum of all recent losses and then dividing the result by the sum of all price movement over the period. This oscillator is similar to other momentum indicators such as the Relative Strength Index and the Stochastic Oscillator, since it is also range-bound (+100 and -100).\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n\nThe security is deemed overbought when the momentum oscillator is above +50 and oversold when it is below -50. Many technical traders add a nine-period moving average to this oscillator to act as a signal line. Bullish signals are generated when the oscillator crosses above the signal, and bearish signals are generated when the oscillator crosses down through the signal.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\n[\nhttp://www.boersenwissen.de/content/content_bin/cont_bin18.html\n]\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nCMO\n(\nint\n period)\n\n\nCMO\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n period)\n\n\nCMO\n(\nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nCMO\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nCMO\n(14)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output for the value of the Chande Momentum Oscillator\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The current value for the Chande Momentum Oscillator is: \" + \nCMO\n(14)[0]);\n\n\nCommodity Channel Index (CCI)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nDeveloped by Donald Lambert and featured in\u00a0\nCommodities\n\u00a0magazine in 1980, the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) is a versatile indicator that can be used to identify a new trend or warn of extreme conditions. Lambert originally developed CCI to identify cyclical turns in commodities, but the indicator can also be successfully applied to indices, ETFs, stocks and other securities. In general, CCI measures the current price level relative to an\u00a0\naverage\n\u00a0price level over a given period of time. CCI is relatively high when prices are far above their average. CCI is relatively low when prices are far below their average. In this manner, CCI can be used to identify overbought and oversold levels.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nCCI measures the difference between a security's price change and its average price change. High positive readings indicate that prices are well above their average, which is a show of strength. Low negative readings indicate that prices are well below their average, which is a show of weakness.\n\n\nThe Commodity Channel Index (CCI) can be used as either a coincident or leading indicator. As a coincident indicator, surges above +100 reflect strong price action that can signal the start of an uptrend. Plunges below -100 reflect weak price action that can signal the start of a downtrend.\n\n\nAs a\u00a0\nleading indicator\n, chartists can look for overbought or oversold conditions that may foreshadow a mean reversion. Similarly, bullish and bearish divergences can be used to detect early momentum shifts and anticipate trend reversals.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nVTAD: [\nhttp://vtadwiki.vtad.de/index.php/Commodity_Channel_Index\n]\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nCCI\n(\nint\n period)\n\n\nCCI\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n period)\n\n\nCCI\n(\nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nCCI\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nCCI\n(14)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output for the CCI value calculated using 14 periods\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The value of the Commodity Channel Index is: \" + \nCCI\n(14));\n\n\nDarvas Boxes\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Darvas boxes are a trading strategy developed in 1956 by former ballroom dancer Nicolas Darvas. Darvas' trading technique involved buying into stocks that were trading at new 52-week highs with correspondingly high volumes.\nA Darvas box is created when the price of a stock rises above the previous 52-week high, but then falls back to a price not far from that high. If the price falls too much, it can be a signal of a false breakout, otherwise the lower price is used as the bottom of the box and the high as the top.\n\n\nA box consists of a top and a lower boundary (floor). Each new box is set up based on a previous box, causing a \u201cstair\u201d formation to be depicted.\nIf a stock does not form a new high after three consecutive days, then the high is marked as the upper boundary. After this, the floor is determined based on the lowest price.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThis system is similar to a trend-following channel breakout system. As soon as one of these boxes breaks out, a new buy or sell signal is generated.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nHere you can read about a trading system based on the Darvas boxes.

If a short position is open at the time, then this is closed. The reverse applies to shorts.\nThe trading system for the Donchian channel is a pure trend-following system based on the concept \u201cbuy when it\u2019s strong, sell when it\u2019s weak\u201d. This breakout system was also used by the \u201cTurtles\u201d. With this indicator, the highs and lows of the last n days are displayed as lines above and below the price development.

The concept contains the following components:\n\n\nDirectional Movement Index (DMI)\n\n\nAverage Directional Movement Index (\nADX\n)\n\n\nTrue Range (\nTR\n)\n\n\nThe Directional Movement Index is a precursor to the Average Directional Movement Index. The DMI shows the percentual strengths of the trend-favoring price movements. The standard application is the smoothed ADX.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe DMI shows the strength of the trend, but not the trend direction. This means that it is particularly suited as a filter for trading systems employing the Parabolic SAR, for example, in order to filter out sideways phases. When the DMI rises (especially above 25), a trend is displayed; anything below that is recognized as a sideways phase. The +DI and the \u2013DI point towards a trend. An uptrend is classified when the +DI is above the \u2013DI. The further apart they drift, the stronger the trend.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nVTAD: [\nhttp://vtadwiki.vtad.de/index.php/DMI_-_Directional_Movement_Index\n]\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nDMI\n(\nint\n period)\n\n\nDMI\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n period)\n\n\nDMI\n(\nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nDMI\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nDMI\n(20)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output for the DMI\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The current DMI value is: \" + \nDMI\n(20)[0]);\n\n\nDouble Stochastics (DSS)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Double Smoothed Stochastic (DSS) was developed by W. Blau. It is a double-smoothed stochastic indicator. After some time, it was further developed by W. Bressert as a variant of the double-smoothed stochastic. This indicator reacts more sensitively towards smaller changes in the price movements and produces more signals than the one developed by Blau. The Bressert version exemplifies extreme zones with more clarity than the Blau version.\n\n\nIrrespective of the various calculation methods, the DSS always remains within a scale of 0 to 100. The extreme zones are the same in the developed stochastics as the original stochastics. The upper extreme area is marked at 80 and the lower extreme zone at 20. These values cannot be changed. For many applications, it is smart to add an additional middle line at 50 and to adapt this to the necessary circumstances.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nValues above 80 are seen as overbought, and below 20 as oversold.

It is a specific variation of the Relative Strength Index.\nChande altered the Dynamic Momentum Index in such a way that the period settings automatically change themselves based on the various factors. He achieved this by coupling it to the RSI so that a volatility component is present. This component is defined based on a 5-day standard deviation of the closing prices. This is then compared to the 10-day average of a 5-day standard deviation.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nIf the DMI is inside the oversold zone, it is reasonable to assume that prices are going to start to fall.\n\n\nFurther and more concise information\n\n\nVTAD: [\nhttp://vtadwiki.vtad.de/index.php/Dynamic_Momentum_Index\n]\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nDMIndex\n(\nint\n smooth)\n\n\nDMIndex\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n smooth)\n\n\nDMIndex\n(\nint\n smooth)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nDMIndex\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n smooth)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nDMIndex\n(3)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nsmooth Smoothing settings\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output of the value for the DMIndex Indicator with a smoothing factor of 3\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The current value for the DMIndex is: \" + \nDMIndex\n(3)[0]);\n\n\nEase of Movement (EOM)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nDeveloped by Richard Arms, Ease of Movement (EMV) is a volume-based oscillator that fluctuates above and below the zero line. As its name implies, it is designed to measure the \"ease\" of price movement. Arms created\u00a0\nEquivolume\n\u00a0charts to visually display price ranges and volume. Ease of Movement takes Equivolume to the next level by quantifying the price/volume relationship and showing the results as an oscillator. In general, prices are advancing with relative ease when the oscillator is in positive territory. Conversely, prices are declining with relative ease when the oscillator is in negative territory.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nWhen the EOM is moving away from the zero line (marker) then an impulse has begun in that direction. During a breakout onto the opposite side of the zero line, it is recommended to enter with the trend direction.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nhttp://www.volumen-analyse.de\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nEaseOfMovement\n(\nint\n smoothing, \nint\n volDivisor)\n\n\nEaseOfMovement\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n smoothing, \nint\n volDivisor)\n\n\nEaseOfMovement\n(\nint\n smoothing, \nint\n volDivisor)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nEaseOfMovement\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n smoothing, \nint\n volDivisor)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nEaseOfMovement\n(14, 10000)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nsmoothing Smoothing settings\n\n\nvolDivisor For calculation of the box ratio (see \u201cCalculation\u201d below)\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nCalculation\n\n\nMidpoint = (High + Low) / 2\nMidpointMove = Midpoint [today] \u2013 Midpoint [yesterday]\nBoxRatio = Volume / (High \u2013 Low)\nEase = MidpointMove / Box Ratio\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output for the values of the EOM line\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The value for the Ease of Movement is: \" + \nEaseOfMovement\n(14, 10000)[0]);\n\n\nFisher Transform\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis indicator was developed by the physicist John Ehlers in 2002. The aim of the indicator is to illustrate turning points. This is achieved by using the Inverse Fisher Transform, which changes indicators in such a way that the movements are less random and the signal quality is improved. The transform compresses or stretches the input values of the function in such a way that the output is highly likely to be between -1 and 1. This results in a clearly identifiable pattern where even indicators such as the RSI become clearer and more precise.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nA system using the Fisher Transform can be found here:\n\nhttps://www.prorealtime.com/de/pdf/probacktest.pdf\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nFisherTransform\n(10)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nFisherTransform\n(\nint\n period)\n\n\nFisherTransform\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n period)\n\n\nFisherTransform\n(\nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nFisherTransform\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output values for the Fisher Transform\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The current value for the Fisher Transform is: \" + \nFisherTransform\n(10)[0]);\n\n\nForecast Oscillator (FOSC)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Forecast Oscillator compares the current price with the value returned by the\u00a0Time Series Forecast\u00a0study. It is calculated as a percentage ratio of the difference between the close price and the value of the Time Series Forecast for the previous bar.\n\n\nWhen the oscillator shows positive values, it suggests that the Time Series Forecast has underestimated the price, and negative values indicate that the actual price is lower than what was predicted by the TSF.

Ichimoku Kinko Hyo translates into \"one look equilibrium chart\". With one look, chartists can identify the trend and look for potential signals within that trend. The indicator was developed by Goichi Hosoda, a journalist, and published in his 1969 book. Even though the Ichimoku Cloud may seem complicated when viewed on the price chart, it is actually a straight-forward indicator that is very usable. It was, after all, created by a journalist, not a rocket scientist! Moreover, the concepts are easy to understand and the signals are well-defined.\n\n\n1.

The previous bar is generally called an outside bar.\nInside bars will sometimes reflect sideways phases, and will also display trend corrections of lower timeframes.

This indicator is similar to Bollinger Bands, which use the standard deviation to set the bands. Instead of using the standard deviation, Keltner Channels use the Average True Range (ATR) to set channel distance. The channels are typically set two Average True Range values above and below the 20-day EMA. The exponential moving average dictates direction and the Average True Range sets channel width.\u00a0Keltner Channels are a trend-following indicator used to identify reversals with channel breakouts and channel direction.\u00a0Channels can also be used to identify overbought and oversold levels when the trend is flat.\n\n\nIn his 1960 book, \nHow to Make Money in Commodities\n, Chester Keltner introduced the \"Ten-Day Moving Average Trading Rule,\" which is credited as the original version of Keltner Channels. This original version started with a 10-day SMA of the typical price {(H+L+C)/3)} as the centerline. The 10-day SMA of the high-low range was added and subtracted to set the upper and lower channel lines. Linda Bradford Raschke introduced the newer version of Keltner Channels in the 1980s. Like Bollinger Bands, this new version used a volatility-based indicator, Average True Range (ATR), to set channel width. (Source: StockCharts.com)\nMiddle line = 20-day exponential moving average\nUpper channel line: 20-day EMA + (2x ATR(10))\nLower channel line: 20-day EMA \u2013 (2xATR(10))\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nIndicators based on channels, bands and envelopes are designed to encompass most price action. Therefore, moves above or below the channel lines warrant attention because they are relatively rare. Trends often start with strong moves in one direction or another. A surge above the upper channel line shows extraordinary strength, while a plunge below the lower channel line shows extraordinary weakness. Such strong moves can signal the end of one trend and the beginning of another.\n\n\nWith an exponential\u00a0\nmoving average\n\u00a0as their foundation, the Keltner Channels are a trend-following indicator. As with moving averages and trend-following indicators, Keltner Channels lag price action. The direction of the moving average dictates the direction of the channel. In general, a downtrend is present when the channel moves lower, while an uptrend exists when the channel moves higher. The trend is flat when the channel moves sideways.\n\n\nA channel upturn and break above the upper trend line can signal the start of an uptrend. A channel downturn and break below the lower trend line can signal the start a downtrend. Sometimes a strong trend does not take hold after a channel breakout and prices oscillate between the channel lines. Such trading ranges are marked by a relatively flat moving average. The channel boundaries can then be used to identify overbought and oversold levels for trading purposes.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nVTAD:

The prices are set as dependent variables and time is set as an independent variable. Using the method to determine the smallest square, a straight line is placed through the price movements in such a way that the distance between the prices and the line deviates minimally. This method also establishes a trend between two points in time. The regression line is found in the middle of the price channel.\nThe indicator provides the end values of multiple linear regression trend lines. Every point along this indicator is thus an end value of a linear regression trend line. The result is similar to a smoothing average, with the difference being that the regression line has less lag.\n\n\nSee \nR-Squared\n, \nLinRegSlope\n, \nLinRegIntercept\n.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\n[\nhttp://www.vtad.de/sites/files/forschung/vtad_Award_2011_Joachim_Lenz_Veroeffentlichung.pdf\n]\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe linear regression indicator is used as a prognosis tool for the future developments of the instrument. If the prices are rising or falling steadily, then it can be expected that they will return to a more realistic/reasonable level. In other words: the indicator shows where the price should be, a deviation from the regression is assumed to be short-lived and to be corrected soon.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nLinReg\n(\nint\n period)\n\n\nLinReg\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n period)\n\n\nLinReg\n(\nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nLinReg\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nLinReg\n(14)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Show the current values of the regression line\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The current value for the linear regression is: \" + \nLinReg\n(14)[0]);\n\n\nLinRegIntercept\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Linear Regression Intercept delivers the value of the regression constant, meaning the mathematical intersection of the regression line with the price axis.\n\n\nA straight line can be accurately determined by using the slope and intercept values.\n\n\nSee \nLinear Regression\n, \nR-Squared,\n \nLinRegSlope\n.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe indicator is not used by itself, but is simply a component of trading systems that analyze trade trends with the help of the linear regression.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nLinRegIntercept\n(\nint\n period)\n\n\nLinRegIntercept\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n period)\n\n\nLinRegIntercept\n(\nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nLinRegIntercept\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nLinRegIntercept\n(14)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Show current value\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The current value of the regression constant is: \" + \nLinRegIntercept\n(14)[0]);\n\n\nLinRegSlope\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Linear Regression Slope delivers the slope of the linear regression line.

The MACD turns two trend-following indicators,\u00a0\nmoving averages\n, into a momentum oscillator by subtracting the longer moving average from the shorter moving average. As a result, the MACD offers the best of both worlds:\u00a0trend following and momentum.\u00a0The MACD fluctuates above and below the zero line as the moving averages converge, cross and diverge. Traders can look for signal line crossovers, centerline crossovers and divergences to generate signals. Because the MACD is unbounded, it is not particularly useful for identifying overbought and oversold levels. The MACD line is the 12-day\u00a0\nExponential Moving Average\n\u00a0(EMA) less the 26-day EMA. Closing prices are used for these moving averages. A 9-day EMA of the MACD line is plotted with the indicator to act as a signal line and identify turns. The MACD histogram represents the difference between MACD and its 9-day EMA, the signal line. The histogram is positive when the MACD line is above its signal line and negative when the MACD line is below its signal line.\n\n\nThe values of\u00a012, 26 and 9\u00a0are the typical settings used with the MACD, however other values can be substituted depending on your trading style and goals.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nAs its name implies, the MACD is all about the convergence and divergence of the two moving averages. Convergence occurs when the moving averages move towards each other. Divergence occurs when the moving averages move away from each other. The shorter moving average (12-day) is faster and responsible for most MACD movements. The longer moving average (26-day) is slower and less reactive to price changes in the underlying security.\n\n\nThe MACD line oscillates above and below the zero line, which is also known as the centerline. These crossovers signal that the 12-day EMA has crossed the 26-day EMA. The direction, of course, depends on the direction of the moving average cross. Positive MACD indicates that the 12-day EMA is above the 26-day EMA. Positive values increase as the shorter EMA diverges further from the longer EMA.\u00a0This means upside momentum is increasing.\u00a0Negative MACD values indicate that the 12-day EMA is below the 26-day EMA. Negative values increase as the shorter EMA diverges further below the longer EMA.\u00a0This means downside\u00a0\nmomentum\n\u00a0is increasing. Signal line crossovers are the most common MACD signals. The signal line is a 9-day EMA of the MACD line. As a moving average of the indicator, it trails the MACD and makes it easier to spot MACD turns. A bullish crossover occurs when the MACD turns up and crosses above the signal line. A bearish crossover occurs when the MACD turns down and crosses below the signal line. Crossovers can last a few days or a few weeks, it all depends on the strength of the move.\n\n\nDue diligence is required before relying on these common signals. Signal line crossovers at positive or negative extremes should be viewed with caution. Even though the MACD does not have upper and lower limits, chartists can estimate historical extremes with a simple visual assessment. It takes a strong move in the underlying security to push momentum to an extreme. Even though the move may continue, momentum is likely to slow and this will usually produce a signal line crossover at the extremities. Volatility in the underlying security can also increase the number of crossovers.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nVTAD: \nhttp://vtadwiki.vtad.de/index.php/MACD\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nMACD\n(\nint\n fast, \nint\n slow, \nint\n smooth)\n\n\nMACD\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n fast, \nint\n slow, \nint\n smooth)\n\n\nFor the value of the MACD line\n\n\nMACD\n(\nint\n fast, \nint\n slow, \nint\n smooth)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nMACD\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n fast, \nint\n slow, \nint\n smooth)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nFor the value of the signal line\n\n\nMACD\n(\nint\n fast, \nint\n slow, \nint\n smooth).Avg[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nMACD\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n fast, \nint\n slow, \nint\n smooth).Avg[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nFor the difference between the MACD and the signal line\n\n\nMACD\n(\nint\n fast, \nint\n slow, \nint\n smooth).Diff[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nMACD\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n fast, \nint\n slow, \nint\n smooth).Diff[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nMACD\n(12,26,9)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nfast Number of periods for the fast EMA calculation\n\n\nslow Number of periods for the slow EMA calculation\n\n\nsmooth Number of periods for the EMA calculation of the signal line\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Show the current values for the MACD\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The current value for the MACD line is: \" + \nMACD\n(12,26,9)[0]);\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The current value for the signal line is: \" + \nMACD\n(12,26,9).Avg[0]);\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The difference between the MACD and the signal line is: \" + \nMACD\n(12,26,9).Diff[0]);\n\n\nMAEnvelopes\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nMoving Average Envelopes are percentage-based envelopes set above and below a moving average. The moving average, which forms the base for this indicator, can be a simple or exponential moving average. Each envelope is then set the same percentage above or below the moving average. This creates parallel bands that follow price action. With a moving average as the base, Moving Average Envelopes can be used as a trend-following indicator. However, this indicator is not limited to just trend following. The envelopes can also be used to identify overbought and oversold levels when the trend is relatively flat.\n\n\nIndicators based on channels, bands and envelopes are designed to encompass most price action. Therefore, moves above or below the envelopes warrant attention. Trends often start with strong moves in one direction or another. A surge above the upper envelope shows extraordinary strength, while a plunge below the lower envelope shows extraordinary weakness. Such strong moves can signal the end of one trend and the beginning of another.\n\n\nWith a\u00a0\nmoving average\n\u00a0as its foundation, Moving Average Envelopes are a natural trend-following indicator. As with moving averages, the envelopes will lag price action. The direction of the moving average dictates the direction of the channel. In general, a downtrend is present when the channel moves lower, while an uptrend exists when the channel moves higher. The trend is flat when the channel moves sideways.\n\n\nSometimes a strong trend does not take hold after an envelope break and prices move into a trading range. Such trading ranges are marked by a relatively flat moving average. The envelopes can then be used to identify overbought and oversold levels for trading purposes. A move above the upper envelope denotes an overbought situation, while a move below the lower envelope marks an oversold condition.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nMAEnvelopes\n(\ndouble\n envelopePercentage, MAEnvelopesMAType maType, \nint\n period)\n\n\nMAEnvelopes\n(IDataSeries input, \ndouble\n envelopePercentage, MAEnvelopesMAType maType, \nint\n period)\n\n\nFor the upper band\n\n\nMAEnvelopes\n(\ndouble\n envelopePercentage, MAEnvelopesMAType maType, \nint\n period).Upper[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nMAEnvelopes\n(IDataSeries input, \ndouble\n envelopePercentage, MAEnvelopesMAType maType, \nint\n period).Upper[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nFor the middle band\n\n\nMAEnvelopes\n(\ndouble\n envelopePercentage, MAEnvelopesMAType maType, \nint\n period).Middle[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nMAEnvelopes\n(IDataSeries input, \ndouble\n envelopePercentage, MAEnvelopesMAType maType, \nint\n period).Middle[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nFor the lower band\n\n\nMAEnvelopes\n(\ndouble\n envelopePercentage, MAEnvelopesMAType maType, \nint\n period).Lower[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nMAEnvelopes\n(IDataSeries input, \ndouble\n envelopePercentage, MAEnvelopesMAType maType, \nint\n period).Lower[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nMAEnvelopes\n(14,SMA,1.5)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nenvelopePercentage Distance of the upper and lower bands from the middle line in percent\n\n\nmaType Type of moving average used, possible choices are:\n- EMA\n- HMA\n- SMA (default)\n- TMA\n- TEMA\n- WMA\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\n//Value output for the upper band\n\n\nPrint\n(\"Upper band of the MA Envelope: \" + \nMAEnvelopes\n(1.5, MAEnvelopesMAType.SMA, 14).Upper[0]);\n\n\n//Value output for the middle band\n\n\nPrint\n(\"Middle band of the MA Envelope: \" + \nMAEnvelopes\n(1.5, MAEnvelopesMAType.SMA, 14).Middle[0]);\n\n\n//Value output for the lower band\n\n\nPrint\n(\"Lower band of the MA Envelope: \" + \nMAEnvelopes\n(1.5, MAEnvelopesMAType.SMA, 14).Lower[0]);\n\n\nMarketPhases\n\n\nThe installation of the Technical Analysis Package is required in order to access this indicator.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Market Phases Indicator is another important component of the Technical Analysis Package.

Many traders swear by this rather simple indicator, because it measures the attenuation of the motion without having to use complex formulas.\nThe momentum indicator is representative of a whole family of indicators that measure the strength of a movement. Other representatives in this case are RSI or CCI etc. In the illustration below, the indicator is a graph that oscillates about a zero point. There is no fixed scale in percentage terms. The value can be removed quite far from the zero point; this generally happens when the price makes an unusually strong jump, thus the indicator primarily shows the direction in which the current prices are moving to.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nEntry signals are generated when the indicator crosses the zero line.\n\n\nSee \nROC\n.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\n [\nhttp://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum_%28Chartanalyse%29\n]\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nMomentum\n(\nint\n period)\n\n\nMomentum\n (IDataSeries input, \nint\n period)\n\n\nMomentum\n (\nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nMomentum\n (IDataSeries input, \nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nMomentum\n(14)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output of the values for the momentum indicator.\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The current value for the momentum is \" + \nMomentum\n(14)[0]);\n\n\nMoney Flow Index (MFI)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Money Flow Index (MFI) is an oscillator that uses both price and volume to measure buying and selling pressure. Created by Gene Quong and Avrum Soudack, MFI is also known as volume-weighted\u00a0\nRSI\n. MFI starts with the typical price for each period. Money flow is positive when the typical price rises (buying pressure) and negative when the typical price declines (selling pressure). A ratio of positive and negative money flow is then plugged into an RSI formula to create an oscillator that moves between zero and one hundred. As a momentum oscillator tied to volume, the Money Flow Index (MFI) is best suited to identify reversals and price extremes with a variety of signals.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe MFI is interpreted similarly to the RSI indicator. The MFI\u2019s decisive factor is much stronger than the RSI\u2019s when it comes to trend direction, due to the fact that volume is included in the calculation.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nVTAD: [\nhttp://vtadwiki.vtad.de/index.php/ Money_Flow_Index\n]\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nMFI\n(\nint\n period)\n\n\nMFI\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n period)\n\n\nMFI\n(\nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nMFI\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nMFI\n(14)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Current MFI value\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The current value for the MFI is: \" + \nMFI\n(14)[0]);\n\n\nMoving Averages\n\n\nVariants\n\n\nDEMA\n - Double Exponential Moving Average\n\n\nEMA\n - Exponential Moving Average\n\n\nHMA\n - Hull Moving Average\n\n\nKAMA\n - Kaufman's Adaptive Moving Average\n\n\nMAMA\n - Mesa Adaptive Moving Average\n\n\nSMA\n - Simple Moving Average\n\n\nTEMA\n - Triple Exponential Moving Average\n\n\nTMA\n - Triangular Moving Average\n\n\nTRIX\n - Triple Exponential Moving Average\n\n\nT3\n - Triple Exponential Moving Average\n\n\nVMA\n - Variable Moving Average\n\n\nVWMA\n - Volume Weighted Moving Average\n\n\nWMA\n - Weighted Moving Average\n\n\nZLEMA\n - Zero Lag Exponential Moving Average\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe arithmetic average, also known as the moving average or simple moving average, smoothes the progression of the price for better trend detection. Moving averages are trend-following indicators; they follow the course and do not lead. Rising averages show uptrends, whereas falling averages display downtrends.\nBy varying the period input, the time delay of the average can be changed. The smaller the period interval, the quicker the reaction time will be, but as a consequence, the smoothing effect will also be diminished. The opposite is true when increasing the period selection. The most popular choices are: 38, 50, 100 and 200 days. The 200-day moving average in particular has a significant importance for institutional traders, since it displays the long-term trend. 200 trading days are equal to a trading year. When the 200 MA is broken, then buy/sell signals are generated.\n\n\nApplications\n\n\nCrossing of two averages\n\n\nThe integration of multiple moving averages is used to identify trend sequences and minimize the number of false signals. When two arithmetic averages are used, whereby one is a short-term and the other a long-term, more interesting signals can be generated. One such application can be seen with Richard Donchian\u2019s methodologies, such as using the 5 and 20-day averages.\nThe Double Crossover Method generates signals in the following way:\n\n\nIf the short-term average crosses the long-term average from below, this is called a Golden Cross, and a buy signal is generated. Higher trading volume reinforces the quality of the signal. The long-term average works as a support line in an uptrend.\n\n\nIf the short-term average crosses the long-term average from above, this is called a Death Cross. It generates a sell signal. Higher trading volume reinforces the signal quality. In a downtrend, the long-term average functions as a resistance line.\n\n\nCrossing of three moving averages\n\n\nAnother method is to use three moving averages (Triple Crossover Method). This method was presented by R.C Allen, who used the 4, 9, and 18-day averages and suggested that a trend change is hinted at when the 4MA crosses the 9MA from bottom to top. An entry is only recommended when all lines are above the 18-day period. An exit is initiated when the 4-day MA moves below the 9-day MA.\n\n\n(Source: VTAD)\n\n\nDEMA - Double Exponential Moving Average\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe DEMA is a technical indicator developed by Patrick Mulloy. The calculation is based on a simple as well as a double exponential moving average.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe DEMA is a fast-working moving average that reacts quicker to market changes.

The weighting applied to the most recent price depends on the number of periods in the moving average. There are three steps to calculating an exponential moving average. First, calculate the simple moving average. An exponential moving average (EMA) has to start somewhere, so a simple moving average is used as the previous period's EMA in the first calculation. Second, calculate the weighting multiplier. Third, calculate the exponential moving average. The formula below is for a 10-day EMA.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe EMA is used by many traders in the most varying of timeframes. It is especially meaningful within the 15, 60 and 240-minute charts. The EMA 200 line is also especially popular with traders.\n\n\nIf the price rises sharply and moves away quickly from the respective EMA line, it is possible to enter countertrend positions in order to profit from the potential return to the moving average.\nGeneral interpretations of the moving averages also apply to the EMA.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nEMA\n(\nint\n period)\n\n\nEMA\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n period)\n\n\nEMA\n(\nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nEMA\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nEMA\n(20)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nCalculation\n\n\nValue.\nSet\n(CurrentBar == 0 ?

The calculation is performed using various weighted moving averages, which is why the smoothing effect is partially diminished. Hull\u2019s methodology is to use square roots of the period instead of the period itself.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe same interpretations as for the moving averages apply to the HMA, the only major distinction being the reduced lag.

The efficiency ratio (the squared efficiency factor) is a measure that can also be used on its own. The trend efficiency is defined as the ratio of the absolute price change from the beginning to the end of the period, and the sum of the absolute daily price changes. At higher trending efficiencies (meaning straight price movements) without much variation, the additional price will have a higher weighting, which corresponds to a shorter day period setting. Lower trending frequencies will have a smaller weighting.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nKaufman mentions that a rising KAMA value can be interpreted as a buying signal, whilst falling KAMA values assume the prices to be falling.\nKaufman also defines a maximum and minimum value for the calculation of the smoothing components. The efficiency ratio is converted using specified maximum and minimum values, which are applied to newly incoming price changes. Kaufman uses 2 (short period) as a minimum value and 30 (long period) as a maximum value. The number of days for the determination of the efficiency ratio is one of the more important parameters for the KAMA.\n\n\nFor a more general interpretation of moving averages, please see the following chapter: \nMoving Averages\n.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nhttp://www.investor-verlag.de/boersenwissen/kama/\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nKAMA\n(\nint\n fast, \nint\n period, \nint\n slow)\n\n\nKAMA\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n fast, \nint\n period, \nint\n slow)\n\n\nKAMA\n(\nint\n fast, \nint\n period, \nint\n slow)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nKAMA\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n fast, \nint\n period, \nint\n slow)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nKAMA\n(2,10,30)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nfast Short period\n\n\nslow Long period\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output for the value of the Kaufman Moving Average(KAMA)\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The current value of the KAMA is \" + \nKAMA\n(2,10,30)[0]);\n\n\nMAMA - Mesa Adaptive Moving Average\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe MAMA indicator is an automatically adapting moving average whose period length is determined via various complex calculations.\nThis indicator originates from publications by John Ehlers and is relatively hard to understand. Ehlers calculates cycles for the price movements to determine length and intensity of individual trend phases. Based on the length of the cycles, the weighting factor for the moving average can be established in varying ways.\n\n\nFAMA\n\nThis indicator is a second line that is known as FAMA in various publications. This line is similar to the underlying exponential moving average and acts as a trigger line.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nFor more concise information, we recommend that you read Ehler\u2019s paper.\n\n\nGeneral information about moving averages can be found here: \nMoving Averages\n.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nhttp://www.tradesignalonline.com/de/lexicon/view.aspx?id=MAMA+adaptive+Moving+Average\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nMAMA\n(\ndouble\n fastLimit, \ndouble\n slowLimit)\n\n\nMAMA\n(IDataSeries input, \ndouble\n fastLimit, \ndouble\n slowLimit)\n\n\nMAMA\n(\ndouble\n fastLimit, \ndouble\n slowLimit)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nMAMA\n(IDataSeries input, \ndouble\n fastLimit, \ndouble\n slowLimit)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nValue of the Following Adaptive Moving Average (FAMA)\n\n\nMAMA\n(\ndouble\n fastLimit, \ndouble\n slowLimit).Fama[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nMAMA\n(IDataSeries input, \ndouble\n fastLimit, \ndouble\n slowLimit).Fama[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nMAMA\n(0.5,0.05)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nfastLimit Upper limit for the alpha value\n\n\nslowLimit Lower limit for the alpha value\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output values for (MAMA)\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The current value for the MAMA is \" + \nMAMA\n(0.5, 0.05)[0]);\n\n\n//Output values for (FAMA)\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The current value for the FAMA is \" + \nMAMA\n(0.5, 0.05).Fama[0]);\n\n\nSMA - Simple Moving Average\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe SMA is the \u201cmother of all averages\u201d and represents the easiest way to display the trend direction of a chart. Viewed from a mathematical perspective, this is the arithmetic mean of a number of individual lengths.\nThe term \u201cmoving\u201d comes from the fact that for this method of establishing an average, the oldest value is always sacrificed to make way for the currently incoming price change. Fundamentally speaking, the length of the period affects the intensity of the smoothing. Shorter periods (e.g. 10 days) will result in the indicator following the price changes relatively closely.\n\n\nThe simple moving average has a couple of drawbacks, which is why several permutations of this indicator have been developed over the course of the years. Primarily, one of the biggest drawbacks is the lagging nature of the indicator and the equal weighting for all data inputs across the time intervals.\n\n\nMore general interpretations and meanings can be found here: \nMoving Averages\n.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nhttp://www.forex-trading-online.de/indikatoren/simple-moving-average-sma\n\n\n[\nhttp://vtadwiki.vtad.de/index.php/SMA#Average-Off-Berechnungsverfahren_.28MMA.29\n]\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nSMA\n(\nint\n period)\n\n\nSMA\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n period)\n\n\nSMA\n(\nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nSMA\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nSMA\n(14)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nCalculation\n\n\nValue.\nSet\n((last + Input[0] - Input[Period]) / Math.\nMin\n(CurrentBar, Period));\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output of the SMA value\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The current SMA value is \" + \nSMA\n(14)[0]);\n\n\nSMA MTF (MultiTimeFrame)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nJust like the other multi-timeframe indicator variations, this allows you to display the SMA of a specific timeframe on a chart of a different timeframe.\n\n\nSee \nBollingerMTF\n, \nEmaMTF\n.\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\nThe image shows a 5-minute chart with an SMA (14) calculated on 4-hour bars\n\n\n\n\nSMMA - Smoothed Moving Average\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Smoothed Moving Average is a combination of the Simple Moving Average and the Exponential Moving Average.

It is a 1-day rate-of-change indicator, meaning that day 2 is divided by day 1, day 3 by day 2 and so on, and this is applied to a triple exponential moving average of the closing prices. The result is a zero line fluctuating oscillator which, based on its stability, is used as trend indicator.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nA buy signal is created when the TRIX indicator crosses the zero line from bottom to top.

This results in a very smooth, soft indicator line.\nThe number of iterations can be set using the parameter tCount.\nThe calculation is the same as that of the DEMA, the only difference being that here, a volume factor is added.

The volume is cumulatively added for each day with a positive close, and subtracted for days with a close smaller than the open.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nGranville theorized that volume precedes price. OBV rises when volume on up days outpaces volume on down days. OBV falls when volume on down days is stronger. A rising OBV reflects positive volume pressure that can lead to higher prices. Conversely, falling OBV reflects negative volume pressure that can foreshadow lower prices. Granville noted in his research that OBV would often move before price. Expect prices to move higher if OBV is rising while prices are either flat or moving down. Expect prices to move lower if OBV is falling while prices are either flat or moving up.\n\n\nThe absolute value of OBV is not important. Chartists should instead focus on the characteristics of the OBV line. First define the trend for OBV. Second, determine if the current trend matches the trend for the underlying security. Third, look for potential support or resistance levels. Once broken, the trend for OBV will change and these breaks can be used to generate signals. Also notice that OBV is based on closing prices. Therefore, closing prices should be considered when looking for divergences or support/resistance breaks. And finally, volume spikes can sometimes throw off the indicator by causing a sharp move that will require a settling period.

Point 2 is often situated at the high of a bar, and point 3 at the low of the same bar. Depending on the timeframe and the fluctuation range, T0 and T1 are fused into one.\n\n\nThe indicator identifies the selected timeframe of the chart, and all trends and trend sizes are labeled accordingly. In times of low volatility, the trend recognition is more sensitive, and the opposite is true for higher volatility. The adaptive methods ensure a balanced recognition of trend sizes.\n\n\nImportant tip:\n\n\nIn some cases the large trend (T0) is not visible, which may sometimes be due to the fact that not enough candles are visible within the chart. A minimum of 500 candles should be loaded in order to ensure this is not the case.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nTrading signals often form at points 2 \n 3: at point 3 as entry signals into a correction phase within a confirmed trend, and at point 2 as a sub-trend in the trend direction of the superior trade.\nThe definition of a trend at points 1 to 3 can be read in \"\nDas gro\u00dfe Buch der Markttechnik\n\" by Michael Voigt (German only).\n\n\nVisualization in the chart\n\n\nThe parameter input settings define which trend sizes are shown in the chart and whether or not they are connected by a line.\n\n\nFor the default settings, the trend T2 is enabled by default.\n\n\nThe depiction in the chart may change with the changing market movements. If the market moves below the last point 3 and breaks the uptrend, the point is marked with a \u201c3?\u201d. The newly created low becomes the new point 2 and the last point 2 becomes point 1.\n\n\n\n\nThe parameter settings are not relevant for the display in the chart and are primarily used for the Condition Escort.\n\n\nThe depiction in the chart is primarily influenced by the settings \u201cDisplay 123\u201d and \u201cDisplay Lines\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nThe settings highlighted in yellow have no influence on the chart.

Wilder called this the \"Parabolic Time/Price System.\" SAR stands for \"stop and reverse,\" which is the actual indicator used in the system.\u00a0\nSAR trails price as the trend extends over time.\n\u00a0The indicator is below prices when prices are rising and above prices when prices are falling. In this regard, the indicator stops and reverses when the price trend reverses and breaks above or below the indicator.\n\n\nWilder introduced the Parabolic Time/Price System in his 1978 book,\u00a0\nNew Concepts in Technical Trading Systems\n. This book also includes\u00a0RSI, Average True Range (ATR), and the Directional Movement Concept (ADX). Despite being developed before the computer age, Wilder's indicators have stood the test of time and remain extremely popular.\n\n\nSAR follows price and can be considered a trend-following indicator. Once a downtrend reverses and starts up, SAR follows prices like a trailing stop. The stop continuously rises as long as the uptrend remains in place. In other words, SAR never decreases in an uptrend and continuously protects profits as prices advance. The indicator acts as a guard against the propensity to lower a stop-loss. Once price stops rising and reverses below SAR, a downtrend starts and SAR is above the price. SAR follows prices lower like a trailing stop. The stop continuously falls as long as the downtrend extends. Because SAR never rises in a downtrend, it continuously protects profits on\u00a0short positions.

While the price zones were originally calculated based on the price developments of the last 2-3 years, the practical concept of pivot points is based on the calculation of price zones in the daily chart, with the previous day\u2019s periods as the basis. The aim is to define price levels that can be used as potential resistance (R1..R3) or support zones (S1..S3).\nThe indicator can be calculated using the following methods:\nClassic, Floor, Woodie, Camarilla, Fibonacci. The calculatory steps are outlined below.\nThe Classic and Floor methods are often wrongly named within literature, which is why in AgenaTrader you will find that the Classic method is labeled as \u201cFloor\u201d and vice versa.\nThe indicator shows the pivot points for intraday charts, and the \u201cShowPrices\u201d parameter allows you to display the price on the levels. The \u201cDaysBack\u201d parameter allows you to set the number of periods in the past that should be used for the calculation. The line coloring can be defined manually.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nTraders prefer to sell above the resistance lines 1 \n 2 (e.g. to build up short positions), and to start building up tactical long positions at the support lines.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nhttp://www.finanznachrichten.de/nachrichten-2008-01/9833653-was-sind-pivot-punkte-und-wie-kann-ich-sie-handeln-005.htm\n\n\nhttp://www.aktienboard.com/forum/f38/7-kapitel-pivot-points-t36428/\n\n\nhttp://www.forexschule.com/schule/wie-man-mit-hilfe-von-pivot-punkten-handelt-50\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nPivotPoints\n()\n\n\nPivotPoints\n(PivotPointsMode mode)\n\n\nPivotPoints\n(PivotPointsMode mode, \nint\n LineWidth, \nbool\n ShowPrices, \nint\n DaysBack, Color RColor, Color PPColor, Color SColor)\n\n\nPivotPoints\n(IDataSeries input, PivotPointsMode mode, \nint\n LineWidth, \nbool\n ShowPrices, \nint\n DaysBack, Color RColor, Color PPColor, Color SColor)\n\n\nPivotPoints\n()[barsAgo]\n\n\nPivotPoints\n(PivotPointsMode mode)[barsAgo]\n\n\nPivotPoints\n(PivotPointsMode mode, \nint\n LineWidth, \nbool\n ShowPrices, \nint\n DaysBack, Color RColor, Color PPColor, Color SColor)[barsAgo]\n\n\nPivotPoints\n(IDataSeries input, PivotPointsMode mode, \nint\n LineWidth, \nbool\n ShowPrices, \nint\n DaysBack, Color RColor, Color PPColor, Color SColor)[barsAgo]\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\nThis class has the following public methods (as data series), which all return double values:\n\n\nPP, S1, S2, S3, R1, R2 ,R3\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nPivotPoints\n().\nPP\n[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nPivotPoints\n(PivotPointsMode.Classic).S3[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nParameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninput\n\n\nInput data series for the indicator\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPivotPointsMode\n\n\nCalculatory method\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n               PivotPointsMode.Classic\n\n               PivotPointsMode.Floor\n\n               PivotPointsMode.Woodie\n\n               PivotPointsMode.Camarilla\n\n               PivotPointsMode.Fibonacci\n\n               Default: floor                                                                     |\n\n\n\n| LineWidth       | Default: 1                                                                        |\n| ShowPrices      | Shows prices next to the lines                                                    \n\n\n               Default: false                                                                     |\n\n\n\n| DaysBack        | The number of historical periods to be included in the display of the pivot lines \n\n\n               Default: 0                                                                         |\n\n\n\n| RColor          | Resistance line color                                                             |\n| PPColor         | Pivot line color                                                                  |\n| SColor          | Support line color                                                                |\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output current pivot point\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The floor pivot point is located at: \" + \nPivotPoints\n()[0]);\n\n\n//Output first support (S1)\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The first pivot support (S1) is at: \" + \nPivotPoints\n().S1[0]);\n\n\nCalculation\n\n\nH=yesterday\u2019s high, L=yesterday\u2019s low, O=yesterday\u2019s open, C=yesterday\u2019s close\n\n\nRange = H-L\n\n\nClassic\n\n\npp = (H + L + C)/3\n\n\nr1 = 2*pp - L\n\n\ns1 = 2*pp - H\n\n\nr2 = pp - s1 + r1\n\n\ns2 = pp - r1 + s1\n\n\nr3 = H + 2*(pp - L)\n\n\ns3 = L - 2*(H - pp)\n\n\nFloor\n\n\npp = (H + L + C)/3\n\n\nr1 = 2*pp - L\n\n\ns1 = 2*pp - H\n\n\nr2 = pp + Range\n\n\ns2 = pp - Range\n\n\nr3 = pp + 2*Range\n\n\ns3 = pp - 2*Range\n\n\nWoodie\n\n\npp = (H + L + 2*C)/4\n\n\nr1 = 2*pp - L\n\n\ns1 = 2*pp - H\n\n\nr2 = pp + H - L\n\n\ns2 = pp - H + L\n\n\nr3 = 0.0\n\n\ns3 = 0.0\n\n\nCamarilla\n\n\npp = (H + L + C)/3\n\n\nr1 = C + Range * 1.1 / 12\n\n\ns1 = C - Range * 1.1 / 12\n\n\nr2 = C + Range * 1.1 / 6\n\n\ns2 = C - Range * 1.1 / 6\n\n\nr3 = C + Range * 1.1 / 4\n\n\ns3 = C - Range * 1.1 / 4\n\n\nFibonacci\n\n\npp = (H + L + C)/3\n\n\nr1 = pp + 0.382 * Range\n\n\ns1 = pp - 0.382 * Range\n\n\nr2 = pp + 0.618 * Range\n\n\ns2 = pp - 0.618 * Range\n\n\nr3 = pp + 0.764 * Range\n\n\ns3 = pp - 0.764 * Range\n\n\nPolarized Fractal Efficiency (PFE)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nDeveloped by Hans Hannula, the PFE is categorized as a momentum indicator, and uses the methods of fractal geometry and the chaos theory to establish the price efficiency of the movements.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nWhen the PFE zigzags around the zero line, no trend is present.

Welles Wilder and is one of the more popular and useful Momentum Oscillators. It compares the size of the most recent winnings with the size of the most recent losses. This means that it evaluates the relationships between the up and down closing prices. The information is depicted between 0 and 100.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nTraditionally, and according to Wilder, RSI is considered overbought when above 70 and oversold when below 30. Signals can also be generated by searching for divergences, failure swings and centerline crossovers. RSI can also be used to identify the general trend. These traditional levels can also be adjusted to better fit the security or analytical requirements. Raising overbought to 80 or lowering oversold to 20 will reduce the number of overbought/oversold readings.

Essentially, the current performance is compared to the performance of the past.\n\n\nThe calculation is carried out by taking the weekly closes (or daily closes) and dividing these by the arithmetic mean of the closing prices of the inspected period.

Developed by Donald Dorsey, it is similar to the RSI, but uses the standard deviation instead of the daily price span.\nThe standard deviation over a period of 10 is used to determine the underlying volatility of the instrument. The RSI indicator is used on the results. The end result is shown on a scale of 1 to 100. Applying the RSI normalizes the results.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nValues above 50 assume an increase in volatility. Values below 50 imply a drop in volatility. Dorsey recommends using the indicator as a filter for other indicators.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\n[\nhttp://vtadwiki.vtad.de/index.php/Relative_Volatility_Index_%28RVI%29\n]\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nRVI\n(\nint\n period)\n\n\nRVI\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n period)\n\n\nRVI\n(\nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nRVI\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nRVI\n(14)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output of the RVI value\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The current value for the RVI is: \" + \nRVI\n(14)[0]);\n\n\nReversalBars\n\n\nThe installation of the Technical Analysis Package is required in order to access this indicator.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Reversal Bars indicator assists you in finding reversal bars within the chart.\nThe indicator has a plot and will output the value of 1 for long reversal bars, -1 for short reversal bars and 0 for none.

R-Squared is the correlation coefficient that describes the quality of the linear regression line.\n\n\nR-Squared derives its name from the calculation, since the value is the square of the correlation coefficient, which in the discipline of mathematics is prefixed with the Greek letter Rho (P).\n\n\nSee \nLinear Regression\n, \nLinRegSlope\n, \nLinRegIntercept\n.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe value of the oscillator fluctuates between 0 and 1. By default, the upper boundary line is located at 0.75, and the lower border is at 0.2.\nIf the prices are in a sideways movement, the data is scattered around the regression line. R-Squared will have a value of 0 in the aforementioned situation.\nIn a strong trend phase, the prices will remain within a tight range for an extended period of time; if these are located close to the regression line then the R-Squared indicator will have a value of 1.

The Standard Deviation is used to calculate many indicators, such as the Bollinger Bands etc.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nA lower standard deviation implies that the data points are located very close to their median value. The trading application assumes that prices will return to their median value.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nVTAD: [\nhttp://vtadwiki.vtad.de/index.php/Standard_Abweichung\n]\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nStdDev\n (\nint\n period)\n\n\nStdDev\n (IDataSeries input, \nint\n period)\n\n\nStdDev\n (\nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nStdDev\n (IDataSeries input, \nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nStdDev\n(14)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output for the StdDev\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The current value for the standard deviation is: \" + \nStdDev\n(14)[0]);\n\n\nStandard Error (StdError)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Standard Error Bands were developed by Jon Anderson, and are similar to the Bollinger Bands, except that their calculation is different. The bands are created by an upper and a lower boundary around a middle line, also known as the linear regression.\nThe subtraction of two standard errors from the final value of the regression line results in the lower standard error band. Since individual closing prices can have a vast influence on the values of the bands, it is necessary to smooth the data using a Simple Moving Average.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nOne of the applications of the standard error bands is the tightening of the bands when prices rise/fall. If the bands tighten, it signifies that a trend is currently in place. A strong trend will continue to tighten the bands.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nhttp://www.forexrealm.com/technical-analysis/technical-indicators/standard-error-bands.html\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nStdError\n(\nint\n period)\n\n\nStdError\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n period)\n\n\nStdError\n(\nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nStdError\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nUpper band\n\n\nStdError\n(\nint\n period).Upper[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nStdError\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n period).Upper[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nLower band\n\n\nStdError\n(\nint\n period).Lower[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nStdError\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n period).Lower[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nStdError\n(21)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output for the values of the middle line\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The middle line is currently at: \" + \nStdError\n(21)[0]);\n\n\n//Output for the lower band\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The lower band of the standard error is currently at: \" + \nStdError\n(21).Lower[0]);\n\n\n//output for the upper band\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The upper band of the standard error is currently at: \" + \nStdError\n(21).Upper[0]);\n\n\nStochastics\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe stochastic indicator was developed by George C. Lane in the 1950s. It belongs to the class \u201cmomentum indicators\u201d (oscillators) and represents the current closing price in relation to a high or low area over a defined number of periods.\nThe stochastic indicator is based on the observation that in an uptrend, the closing price is close to the daily high, while in a downtrend, the closing price is closer to the daily low.\nThe stochastic indicator consists of two exponential Average Lines (%K and %D), both of which range between 0 and 100.\nThere are two types of stochastic: the classic slow stochastic and the fast stochastic.\n\n\nFast stochastic:\n\nThe %D line is the smoothing average of the %K line\n\n\nSlow stochastic:\n\nThe %D is the basis on which the smoothing average is calculated. The slow stochastic smoothes the fast stochastic, thus stabilizing the oscillator.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe closing prices found in the upper area imply an accumulation (buying pressure); the lower area represents selling pressure.\nThe stochastic indicator is a classic oscillator, and is primarily used in sideways markets in order to determine the reversal points. Days with a stable trend will not provide the indicator with any relevant or valuable results/information.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nVTAD: \nhttp://vtadwiki.vtad.de/index.php/Stochastik\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nStochastics\n(\nint\n periodD, \nint\n periodK, \nint\n smooth)\n\n\nStochastics\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n periodD, \nint\n periodK, \nint\n smooth)\n\n\nFor the %D line\n\n\nStochastics\n(\nint\n periodD, \nint\n periodK, \nint\n smooth).D[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nStochastics\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n periodD, \nint\n periodK, \nint\n smooth).D[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nFor the %K line\n\n\nStochastics\n(\nint\n periodD, \nint\n periodK, \nint\n smooth).K[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nStochastics\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n periodD, \nint\n periodK, \nint\n smooth).K[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nStochastics\n(7,14,3)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiodD Number of periods to be used for the %K smoothing\n\n\nperiodK Number of bars included in the %K calculation\n\n\nsmooth Number of periods for the smoothing of %D\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output for the %K line\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The stochastic line %K is currently at: \" + \nStochastics\n(3, 14, 7).K[0]);\n\n\n//Output for the %D line\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The stochastic line %D is currently at: \" + \nStochastics\n(3, 14, 7).D[0]);\n\n\nStochastics Fast\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nSee stochastics.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nClosing prices that are constantly in the upper area indicate accumulation (i.e. buying pressure), whilst the distribution (i.e. selling pressure) is shown by an indicator value in the lower area.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nVTAD: \nhttp://vtadwiki.vtad.de/index.php/Stochastik\n\n\n[\nhttp://www.charttec.de/html/indikator_stochastics.php\n]\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nStochasticsFast\n(\nint\n periodD, \nint\n periodK)\n\n\nStochasticsFast\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n periodD, \nint\n periodK)\n\n\nFor the %D line\n\n\nStochasticsFast\n(\nint\n periodD, \nint\n periodK).D[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nStochasticsFast\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n periodD, \nint\n periodK).D[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nFor the %K line\n\n\nStochasticsFast\n(\nint\n periodD, \nint\n periodK).K[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nStochasticsFast\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n periodD, \nint\n periodK).K[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nStochasticsFast\n(7,14)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiodD Number of periods for the smoothing of %K\n\n\nperiodK Number of periods included in the calculation of %K\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output for the %K line of the fast stochastic\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The stochastic line %K is currently at: \" + \nStochasticsFast\n(3, 14).K[0]);\n\n\n//Output %D line\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The stochastic line %D is currently at: \" + \nStochasticsFast\n(3, 14).D[0]);\n\n\nStochastics RSI (StochRSI)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis is a calculation of the stochastic based on of the RSI indicator.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe indicator provides fast and precise extreme values/points in the price movements.

It is based on the median values of the candles and measures the volatility as a span between high and low, ignoring potential price gaps. Originating from a starting value, the indicator will continue to run in one direction until the market turns direction in combination with rising volatility. The indicator then changes its starting value to that of the counter-direction. The indicator is programmed so that only the trend direction can initiate a change. Dropping volatility and movements against a trend direction will lead to the indicator moving along horizontally.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThere are multiple interpretations and applications for the SuperTrend. Forex traders prefer to trade the crosses directly. This way, the system will continuously be inside the market and only needs to be complemented by a stop and further trading logic settings.\nAnalytically speaking, the SuperTrend indicator is only able to provide information about the current trend. If the market is above the indicator, then an uptrend exists, otherwise a downtrend is in force.\nThe indicator can be used as an exit for additional trading systems, meaning that an open position can be closed if a trend change occurs.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nSuperTrend\n(SuperTrendMode stMode, \nint\n length, \ndouble\n multiplier, SuperTrendMAType maType, \nint\n smooth)\n\n\nSuperTrend\n(IDataSeries input, SuperTrendMode stMode, \nint\n length, \ndouble\n multiplier, SuperTrendMAType maType, \nint\n smooth)\n\n\nSuperTrend\n(SuperTrendMode stMode, \nint\n length, \ndouble\n multiplier, SuperTrendMAType maType, \nint\n smooth)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nSuperTrend\n(IDataSeries input, SuperTrendMode stMode, \nint\n length, \ndouble\n multiplier, SuperTrendMAType maType, \nint\n smooth)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nFor the values of the uptrend:\n\n\nSuperTrend\n(SuperTrendMode stMode, \nint\n length, \ndouble\n multiplier, SuperTrendMAType maType, \nint\n smooth).UpTrend[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nSuperTrend\n(IDataSeries input, SuperTrendMode stMode, \nint\n length, \ndouble\n multiplier, SuperTrendMAType maType, \nint\n smooth).UpTrend[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nFor the values of the downtrend:\n\n\nSuperTrend\n(SuperTrendMode stMode, \nint\n length, \ndouble\n multiplier, SuperTrendMAType maType, \nint\n smooth).DownTrend[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nSuperTrend\n(IDataSeries input, SuperTrendMode stMode, \nint\n length, \ndouble\n multiplier, SuperTrendMAType maType, \nint\n smooth).DownTrend[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nSuperTrend\n(...).UpTrend[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninput\n\n\nInput data series for the indicator\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaType\n\n\nFor the calculation of the MA, the following methods can be used:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          SuperTrendMAType.HMA\n\n          SuperTrendMAType.SMA\n\n          SuperTrendMAType.SMMA\n\n          SuperTrendMAType.TEMA\n\n          SuperTrendMAType.TMA\n\n          SuperTrendMAType.VMA\n\n          SuperTrendMAType.VWMA\n\n          SuperTrendMAType.WMA\n\n          Also see: [*HMA*], [*SMA*], [*SMMA*], [*TEMA*], [*TMA*], [*VMA*], [*VWMA*], [*WMA*][*VMA*].\n\n          Default: HMA                                                                                                                                                            |\n\n\n\n| multiplier | This is a multiplier for the internal calculation of the offset.

Clearly defined and identifiable support areas provide favorable entry opportunities, while resistance areas provide target zones to exit those trades.\nOnce broken, these areas tend to reverse their function, meaning that a broken support zone becomes a resistance zone.\n\n\n[\nhttp://finanzportal.wiwi.uni-saarland.de/tech/Kapitel5_4.htm\n]\n\n\nParameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nATRRangeFactor\n\n\nSettings for the width of the support/resistance area as calculated by the ATR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe smallest configurable value is 0.1; default is 0.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevels\n\n\nThis setting defines how many S/R zones of the same type are displayed.

The trend is established according to a regression equation using the smallest square formula. The aim is to extrapolate the future price movements based on the currently existing data.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe TSF reacts faster than the moving averages. These always have time delays when depicting the pre-existing trends. The TSF formula never allows the distance to the current price to become too large, thus permitting sharper trade reversal recognition.\n\n\nAn entry is placed when the price breaks the TSF line from bottom to top.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\n[\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series\n]\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nTSF\n(\nint\n forecast, \nint\n period)\n\n\nTSF\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n forecast, \nint\n period)\n\n\nTSF\n(\nint\n forecast, \nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nTSF\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n forecast, \nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nTSF\n(3,14)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\nforecast Number of bars used for the forecast\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output the TSF values\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The current value for the TSF is: \" + \nTSF\n(3, 14)[0]);\n\n\nTools\n\n\nConstant Lines\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Constant Lines tool draws up to four freely configurable horizontal lines within the chart.

If IncludeWeekends = true, the price data for a trading session resulting from the weekend data is added to the last trading session.\n\n\nThis is generally applicable to traders in different time zones. For example, a trader located in Germany will receive EURUSD data that beginning on Sunday evenings in America.\nTo add the couple of hours that are transcribed on Sunday to the previous Friday\u2019s session, you simply need to set IncludeWeekends = true.\nThe first picture shows IncludeWeekends = false:\n\n\n\n\nThe second picture shows Include Weekends = true:\n\n\n\n\nShow Prices parameter\n\nIf set to \u201ctrue\u201d, prices are displayed in addition to the line itself.\n\n\n\n\nExtend high lines and Extend low lines parameters\n. If set to \u201ctrue\u201d, the highs and lows that have not yet been \u201ebreached\u201c by the price will be extended onto the right-hand side of the chart using dotted lines.\n\n\n\n\nGetDayBar\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe function GetDayBar() provides all values (open, high, low, close, time, median, typical, volume, and weighted) for a specific day (session) in the past or for the current session.\nGetDayBar() is not recommended for use inside the chart.

The TSI combines the advantages of both indicator groups.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe TSI line moves between 100 and -100. Most values are between +25 and -25. These trigger lines can be used to anticipate overbought or oversold situations. A rising TSI signals an uptrend, while falling TSI suggests a downtrend.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\n[\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_strength_index\n]\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nTSI\n(\nint\n fast, \nint\n slow)\n\n\nTSI\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n fast, \nint\n slow)\n\n\nTSI\n(\nint\n fast, \nint\n slow)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nTSI\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n fast, \nint\n slow)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nTSI\n(3,14)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nfast Number of bars included in the calculation of the fast EMA\n\n\nslow Number of bars included in the calculation of the slow EMA\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output of the current value for the True Strength Index (TSI)\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The current value for the TSI is \" + \nTSI\n(3, 14)[0]);\n\n\nUltimate Oscillator\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Ultimate Oscillator was developed by Larry Williams and published in 1985 for the first time. The indicator is calculated using the weighted sum of three oscillators in various timeframes. The three timeframes represent short-term, middle and long-term market cycles. The typical period lengths are 7, 14 and 28. The value of the indicator fluctuates between 0 and 100. Values above 70 are overbought, and values below 30 are oversold.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nWilliams defined the following criteria for a buy signal:\n\n\nA bullish divergence between price and oscillator can be observed, meaning that the market makes a new low but the oscillator remains unchanged.\n\n\nWhile this divergence is forming, the oscillator falls below 30.\n\n\nThe oscillator will then resume its upward move towards the high at which it peaked before the divergence began forming.\n\n\nThe buy signal is created when the price breaches that last high.\n\n\nThe long position is closed if the oscillator rises above 70 or if the oscillator rises above 50 and then falls back below 45.\nA sell signal consists of bearish divergences forming above 70. These positions are closed once the 30 level marker is breached.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nUltimateOscillator\n(\nint\n fast, \nint\n intermediate, \nint\n slow)\n\n\nUltimateOscillator\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n fast, \nint\n intermediate, \nint\n slow)\n\n\nUltimateOscillator\n(\nint\n fast, \nint\n intermediate, \nint\n slow)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nUltimateOscillator\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n fast, \nint\n intermediate, \nint\n slow)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nUltimateOscillator\n (5)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninput\n\n\nInput data series for the indicator\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfast\n\n\nNumber of bars for the calculation of the short-term oscillator\n\n\n\n\n\n\nintermediate\n\n\nNumber of bars for the calculation of the intermediate oscillator\n\n\n\n\n\n\nslow\n\n\nNumber of bars for the calculation of the slow indicator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n// Output of the values for the UltimateOscillator with settings of 7,14,28\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The current value for the Ultimate Oscillator is \" + \nUltimateOscillator\n(7, 14, 28)[0]);\n\n\nVolume (VOL)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis is the volume for the shares, futures, ETFs etc. traded within a certain time period.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nhttp://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volumenanalyse\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nVOL\n()\n\n\nVOL\n(IDataSeries input)\n\n\nVOL\n()[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nVOL\n(IDataSeries input)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nVOL\n()[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameter\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output of the current volume\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The current volume is \" + \nVOL\n()[0]);\n\n\nVolume Moving Average (VOLMA)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Volume Moving Average is calculated by applying an exponential moving average to the respective volume of each individual period, i.e. their EMA (volume).\n\n\nCaution:\n\nIn literature, the abbreviation for the Variable Moving Average (VMA) is often confused with the Volume Moving Average (VOLMA).\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe VOLMA indicator helps you to find and assess the relative volume of a period.\n\n\nSome simple guidelines should be followed:\n\n\nThe volume should be above the VOLMA at a break\n\n\nAfter a volume spike (high), an exhaustion phase will kick in. The exhaustion can lead to a complete reversal of the price movement.

The result is similar to the MACD or any other oscillator where moving averages are applied.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe Volume Oscillator is used to determine the trend strength. If developments in the price of the share are accompanied by disproportionate volume oscillator values, this should be regarded as highly relevant. In this way, the indicator can be used to filter out false signals.\nValues above zero mean that the shortest moving average of the volume is above the long-term moving average.

Each bar inside the histogram represents the cumulative traded volume for a specific price level. The bar at which the calculations have started are marked with a \u201c#\u201d symbol.\nThe histogram bars have different coloring: executions at or above the ask are interpreted as buys and are colored in green. Trades at or below the bid are interpreted as sells and are colored in red. Neutral executions are colored in grey.\nThe indicator only works with a real-time data feed. After you make changes in the properties window, the indicator will be restarted and all calculated values up to this point will be lost.\n\n\nSee: \nVolumeZones\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nPrices with especially high trading volume will have a more satiated accumulation and distribution at their respective levels. This leads to price resistance/support zones being formed.\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nVolume Rate of Change (VROC)\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Volume Rate of Change (VROC) is identical to the ROC indicator, with the primary difference being that instead of price data, the volume data (VOL) is used.

Falling bars are colored in red.\nThe indicator is intended for use with historical data only. To see volume changes in real-time, please consider using the VolumeProfile.\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\nWilliams %R\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nDeveloped by Larry Williams, Williams %R is a momentum indicator that is the inverse of the Fast\u00a0\nStochastic Oscillator\n. Also referred to as %R, Williams %R reflects the level of the close relative to the highest high for the look-back period. In contrast, the Stochastic Oscillator reflects the level of the close relative to the lowest low. %R corrects for the inversion by multiplying the raw value by -100. As a result, the Fast Stochastic Oscillator and Williams %R produce the exact same lines, only the scaling is different. Williams %R oscillates between 0 to -100. Readings from 0 to -20 are considered overbought. Readings from -80 to -100 are considered oversold. Unsurprisingly, signals derived from the Stochastic Oscillator are also applicable to Williams %R. (Source: Stockcharts.com)\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nAs with the Stochastic Oscillator, Williams %R reflects the level of the close relative to the high-low range over a given period of time. Assume that the highest high equals 110, the lowest low equals 100 and the close equals 108. The high-low range is 10 (110 - 100), which is the denominator in the %R formula. The highest high less the close equals 2 (110 - 108), which is the numerator. 2 divided by 10 equals 0.20. Multiply this number by -100 to get -20 for %R. Williams %R would equal -30 if the close was 103 (0.30 x -100).\n\n\nThe centerline, -50, is an important level to watch. Williams %R moves between 0 and -100, which makes -50 the midpoint. Think of it as the 50 yard line in football. The offense has a higher chance of scoring when it crosses the 50 yard line. The defense has an edge as long as it prevents the offense from crossing the 50 yard line. A Williams %R cross above -50 signals that prices are trading in the upper half of their high-low range for the given look-back period. This suggests that the cup is half full. Conversely, a cross below -50 means prices are trading in the bottom half of the given look-back period. This suggests that the cup is half empty.\n\n\nLow readings (below -80) indicate that the price is near its low for the given time period. High readings (above -20) indicate that the price is near its high for the given time period.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\nhttp://www.broker-test.de/finanzwissen/technische-analyse/williams-percent-r/\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nWilliamsR\n(\nint\n period)\n\n\nWilliamsR\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n period)\n\n\nWilliamsR\n(\nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nWilliamsR\n(IDataSeries input, \nint\n period)[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nWhen using this method with an index (e.g. \nWilliamsR\n(14)[\nint\n barsAgo] ), the value of the indicator will be issued for the referenced bar.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ninput Input data series for the indicator\n\n\nperiod Number of bars included in the calculations\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Output of the current value for the WilliamsR\n\n\nPrint\n(\"The current value for the WilliamsR is: \" + \nWilliamsR\n(14)[0]);\n\n\nZigZag\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe ZigZag indicator finds extreme points for various timeframes.

The APZ is a volatility-based indicator that appears as a set of bands placed over a price chart. Especially useful in non-trending, choppy markets, the APZ was created to help traders find potential turning points in the markets. The APZ is based on a short-term double-smoothed exponential moving average that reacts quickly to price changes with reduced lag. The bands form a channel that surrounds the average price and tracks the price changes. If the price crosses the upper band of the zone then this will present you with an opportunity to trade a reversal. The opposite is true for the lower band.",

Chande chose this name because the indicators are designed to reveal the beginning of a new trend. The Aroon indicators measure the number of periods since the price recorded an x-day high or low. There are two separate indicators: Aroon-Up and Aroon-Down. A 25-day Aroon-Up measures the number of days since a 25-day high. A 25-day Aroon-Down measures the number of days since a 25-day low. In this sense, the Aroon indicators are quite different from typical\u00a0 momentum oscillators , which focus on price relative to time. Aroon is unique because it focuses on time relative to price. Chartists can use the Aroon indicators to spot emerging trends, identify consolidations, define correction periods and anticipate reversals.  (Source: Stockcharts.com)",

At its most basic, the bulls have the edge when Aroon-Up is above 50 and Aroon-Down is below 50. This indicates a greater propensity for new x-day highs than lows. The converse is true for a downtrend. The bears have the edge when Aroon-Up is below 50 and Aroon-Down is above 50.  A surge to 100 indicates that a trend may be emerging. This can be confirmed with a decline in the other Aroon indicator. For example, a move to 100 in Aroon-Up combined with a decline below 30 in Aroon-Down shows upside strength. Consistently high readings mean prices are regularly hitting new highs or new lows for the specified period. Prices are moving consistently higher when Aroon-Up remains in the 70-100 range for an extended period. Conversely, consistently low readings indicate that prices are seldom hitting new highs or lows. Prices are NOT moving lower when Aroon-Down remains in the 0-30 range for an extended period.

The examples in his books are based on these instruments, not stocks. This does not mean his indicators cannot be used with stocks.

            "text": "Developed by J. Welles Wilder, the Average True Range (ATR) is an indicator that measures\u00a0 volatility . As with most of his indicators, Wilder designed ATR with commodities and daily prices in mind. Commodities are frequently more volatile than stocks. They are often subject to gaps and limit moves, which occur when a commodity opens up or down its maximum allowed move for the session. A volatility formula based only on the high-low range would fail to capture volatility from gap or limit moves. Wilder created Average True Range to capture this \"missing\" volatility. It is important to remember that ATR does not provide an indication of price direction, just volatility.  Wilder features ATR in his 1978 book,\u00a0 New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems . This book also includes the Parabolic SAR, RSI and the Directional Movement Concept (ADX). Despite being developed before the computer age, Wilder's indicators have stood the test of time and remain extremely popular.  Wilder started with a concept called\u00a0 True Range (TR) , which is defined as the greatest of the following:    Method 1: current high minus the current low    Method 2: current high minus the previous close (absolute value)    Method 3: current Low minus the previous close (absolute value)    Absolute values are used to ensure positive numbers. After all, Wilder was interested in measuring the distance between two points, not the direction. If the current period's high is above the prior period's high and the low is below the prior period's low, then the current period's high-low range will be used as the True Range. This is an outside day that would use method 1 to calculate the TR. This is pretty straightforward. Methods 2 and 3 are used when there is a gap or an inside day. A gap occurs when the previous close is greater than the current high (signaling a potential gap down or limit move) or the previous close is lower than the current low (signaling a potential gap up or limit move). The image below shows examples of when methods 2 and 3 are appropriate.",

            "text": "Developed by John Bollinger, Bollinger Bands\u00ae are volatility bands placed above and below a moving average. Volatility is based on the\u00a0 standard deviation , which changes as volatility increases and decreases. The bands automatically widen when volatility increases and narrow when volatility decreases. This dynamic nature of Bollinger Bands also means they can be used on different securities with the standard settings. For signals, Bollinger Bands can be used to identify M-Tops and W-Bottoms or to determine the strength of the trend.  Bollinger Bands consist of a middle band with two outer bands. \u00a0The middle band is a\u00a0simple moving average\u00a0that is usually set at 20 periods. A simple moving average is used because the standard deviation formula also uses a simple moving average. The look-back period for the standard deviation is the same as for the simple moving average. The outer bands are usually set 2 standard deviations above and below the middle band. Settings can be adjusted to suit the characteristics of particular securities or trading styles. Bollinger recommends making small incremental adjustments to the standard deviation multiplier. Changing the number of periods for the moving average also affects the number of periods used to calculate the standard deviation. Therefore, only small adjustments are required for the standard deviation\u00a0 multiplier . An increase in the moving average period would automatically increase the number of periods used to calculate the standard deviation and would also warrant an increase in the standard deviation\u00a0 multiplier . With a 20-day SMA and 20-day Standard Deviation, the standard deviation multiplier is set at 2. Bollinger suggests increasing the standard deviation multiplier to 2.1 for a 50-period SMA and decreasing the standard deviation multiplier to 1.9 for a 10-period SMA.  Bollinger Bands reflect direction with the 20-period SMA and volatility with the upper/lower bands. As such, they can be used to determine if prices are relatively high or low.\u00a0 According to Bollinger, the bands should contain 88-89% of price action, which makes a move outside the bands significant. \u00a0Technically, prices are relatively high when above the upper band and relatively low when below the lower band. However, relatively high should not be regarded as bearish or as a sell signal. Likewise, relatively low should not be considered bullish or as a buy signal. Prices are high or low for a reason. As with other indicators, Bollinger Bands are not meant to be used as a stand-alone tool. Chartists should combine Bollinger Bands with basic trend analysis and other indicators for confirmation. (Source: Stockcharts)  The calculation is performed in the following manner:  Upper band = middle band + 2 standard deviations\nMiddle band = average of 20 periods\nLower band = middle period \u2013 2 standard deviations  More information can be found here:  BollingerMTF ,  Bollinger Percent %B ,  Bollinger Bands Width",

If the close price is equal to the lower Bollinger Band,\u00a0%b\u00a0will be 0.0 (percent). A\u00a0%b\u00a0value of 50 means the close price is equal to the middle Bollinger Band.\nFurthermore, readings above 100 and below 0 indicate that the close price is outside of the Bollinger Bands by a corresponding percentage of the Bollinger Bandwidth. A\u00a0%b\u00a0value of 125 means that the close price is above the upper Bollinger Band by 25% of the Bandwidth. A\u00a0%b\u00a0value of -25 means that the close price is below the lower Bollinger Band by 25% of the Bandwidth.  See  Bollinger Bands ,  BBWidth  An additional application: normalizing indicators  Bollinger bands and thus the %b indicator can be applied not only to the prices of stocks, futures etc. but also to time series with fundamental data, volume data and other indicators. This is especially interesting when you need to know if a value is relatively high or low; in this case, the %b indicator will offer you a different perspective. If you want to know whether the volume of a stock is exceedingly high or low you can simply apply it to the volume data.\nJohn Bollinger sees the application of the %b onto other indicators as one of the most important aspects of the indicator. If you want to normalize an indicator with %b, it is important to first calculate the indicator (e.g. the RSI) using the %b for the calculation of the indicator instead of the price data. The application of the %b essentially unfolds in the same manner as the application of Bollinger bands onto the indicator itself. The intersection points between the bands and the indicators will thus be 1 and 0. Essentially, the relative position of the original indicator will be displayed in relation to its upper and lower bands. Thus the boundaries of the original indicator will be removed.\nJohn Bollinger himself wrote that: \u201cYou\u2019re defining a high or low point on a relative basis, this may allow you to gain a deeper insight and understanding not provided by traditional indicators and guidelines.\u201d\nJohn Bollinger provides several parameters for the %b calculation, such as 40-day periods and a factor of 2.0 for a 9-day RSI, and a 50-day period with a factor of 2.1 for the calculation of %b.

Chaikin attempts to expand on and improve the On-Balance Volume created by Granville. With the CMF, the position of the closing price within the trading range is placed in relation to the volume. Basically, this means that the trading volume is multiplied by the price. The trading volume shows the amount of money that has \u201cflowed\u201d into the stock or has been \u201cremoved\u201d; the indicator merely displays whether it has been accumulated (buying pressure) or has been removed (distribution).

Lambert originally developed CCI to identify cyclical turns in commodities, but the indicator can also be successfully applied to indices, ETFs, stocks and other securities. In general, CCI measures the current price level relative to an\u00a0 average \u00a0price level over a given period of time. CCI is relatively high when prices are far above their average. CCI is relatively low when prices are far below their average. In this manner, CCI can be used to identify overbought and oversold levels.",

High positive readings indicate that prices are well above their average, which is a show of strength. Low negative readings indicate that prices are well below their average, which is a show of weakness.  The Commodity Channel Index (CCI) can be used as either a coincident or leading indicator. As a coincident indicator, surges above +100 reflect strong price action that can signal the start of an uptrend. Plunges below -100 reflect weak price action that can signal the start of a downtrend.  As a\u00a0 leading indicator , chartists can look for overbought or oversold conditions that may foreshadow a mean reversion. Similarly, bullish and bearish divergences can be used to detect early momentum shifts and anticipate trend reversals.",

If the price falls too much, it can be a signal of a false breakout, otherwise the lower price is used as the bottom of the box and the high as the top.  A box consists of a top and a lower boundary (floor). Each new box is set up based on a previous box, causing a \u201cstair\u201d formation to be depicted.\nIf a stock does not form a new high after three consecutive days, then the high is marked as the upper boundary.

The indicator was developed by Goichi Hosoda, a journalist, and published in his 1969 book. Even though the Ichimoku Cloud may seem complicated when viewed on the price chart, it is actually a straight-forward indicator that is very usable. It was, after all, created by a journalist, not a rocket scientist! Moreover, the concepts are easy to understand and the signals are well-defined.  1. Tenkan Sen \u2013 conversion line This is the median value of the 9-period high and the 9-period low.  2. Kinjun Sen \u2013 the baseline This is the midpoint of the 26-period high and low.  3.

Senkou Span A \u2013 the first leading line This is the midpoint between the conversion line and the baseline. The leading Span A forms one of the two cloud boundaries. It is referred to as leading because it is plotted 26 periods in the future and thus forms the faster cloud boundary.  5. Senkou Span B \u2013 the second leading line This is the midpoint of the 52-day high-low range projected 26 periods into the future, and forms the slower cloud boundary.

This indicator is similar to Bollinger Bands, which use the standard deviation to set the bands. Instead of using the standard deviation, Keltner Channels use the Average True Range (ATR) to set channel distance. The channels are typically set two Average True Range values above and below the 20-day EMA. The exponential moving average dictates direction and the Average True Range sets channel width.\u00a0Keltner Channels are a trend-following indicator used to identify reversals with channel breakouts and channel direction.\u00a0Channels can also be used to identify overbought and oversold levels when the trend is flat.  In his 1960 book,  How to Make Money in Commodities , Chester Keltner introduced the \"Ten-Day Moving Average Trading Rule,\" which is credited as the original version of Keltner Channels. This original version started with a 10-day SMA of the typical price {(H+L+C)/3)} as the centerline. The 10-day SMA of the high-low range was added and subtracted to set the upper and lower channel lines. Linda Bradford Raschke introduced the newer version of Keltner Channels in the 1980s. Like Bollinger Bands, this new version used a volatility-based indicator, Average True Range (ATR), to set channel width. (Source: StockCharts.com)\nMiddle line = 20-day exponential moving average\nUpper channel line: 20-day EMA + (2x ATR(10))\nLower channel line: 20-day EMA \u2013 (2xATR(10))",

            "text": "Indicators based on channels, bands and envelopes are designed to encompass most price action. Therefore, moves above or below the channel lines warrant attention because they are relatively rare. Trends often start with strong moves in one direction or another. A surge above the upper channel line shows extraordinary strength, while a plunge below the lower channel line shows extraordinary weakness. Such strong moves can signal the end of one trend and the beginning of another.  With an exponential\u00a0 moving average \u00a0as their foundation, the Keltner Channels are a trend-following indicator. As with moving averages and trend-following indicators, Keltner Channels lag price action. The direction of the moving average dictates the direction of the channel. In general, a downtrend is present when the channel moves lower, while an uptrend exists when the channel moves higher. The trend is flat when the channel moves sideways.  A channel upturn and break above the upper trend line can signal the start of an uptrend. A channel downturn and break below the lower trend line can signal the start a downtrend. Sometimes a strong trend does not take hold after a channel breakout and prices oscillate between the channel lines. Such trading ranges are marked by a relatively flat moving average. The channel boundaries can then be used to identify overbought and oversold levels for trading purposes.",

The MACD turns two trend-following indicators,\u00a0 moving averages , into a momentum oscillator by subtracting the longer moving average from the shorter moving average. As a result, the MACD offers the best of both worlds:\u00a0trend following and momentum.\u00a0The MACD fluctuates above and below the zero line as the moving averages converge, cross and diverge. Traders can look for signal line crossovers, centerline crossovers and divergences to generate signals. Because the MACD is unbounded, it is not particularly useful for identifying overbought and oversold levels. The MACD line is the 12-day\u00a0 Exponential Moving Average \u00a0(EMA) less the 26-day EMA. Closing prices are used for these moving averages. A 9-day EMA of the MACD line is plotted with the indicator to act as a signal line and identify turns. The MACD histogram represents the difference between MACD and its 9-day EMA, the signal line. The histogram is positive when the MACD line is above its signal line and negative when the MACD line is below its signal line.  The values of\u00a012, 26 and 9\u00a0are the typical settings used with the MACD, however other values can be substituted depending on your trading style and goals.",

            "text": "As its name implies, the MACD is all about the convergence and divergence of the two moving averages. Convergence occurs when the moving averages move towards each other. Divergence occurs when the moving averages move away from each other. The shorter moving average (12-day) is faster and responsible for most MACD movements. The longer moving average (26-day) is slower and less reactive to price changes in the underlying security.  The MACD line oscillates above and below the zero line, which is also known as the centerline. These crossovers signal that the 12-day EMA has crossed the 26-day EMA. The direction, of course, depends on the direction of the moving average cross. Positive MACD indicates that the 12-day EMA is above the 26-day EMA. Positive values increase as the shorter EMA diverges further from the longer EMA.\u00a0This means upside momentum is increasing.\u00a0Negative MACD values indicate that the 12-day EMA is below the 26-day EMA. Negative values increase as the shorter EMA diverges further below the longer EMA.\u00a0This means downside\u00a0 momentum \u00a0is increasing. Signal line crossovers are the most common MACD signals. The signal line is a 9-day EMA of the MACD line. As a moving average of the indicator, it trails the MACD and makes it easier to spot MACD turns. A bullish crossover occurs when the MACD turns up and crosses above the signal line. A bearish crossover occurs when the MACD turns down and crosses below the signal line. Crossovers can last a few days or a few weeks, it all depends on the strength of the move.  Due diligence is required before relying on these common signals. Signal line crossovers at positive or negative extremes should be viewed with caution. Even though the MACD does not have upper and lower limits, chartists can estimate historical extremes with a simple visual assessment. It takes a strong move in the underlying security to push momentum to an extreme. Even though the move may continue, momentum is likely to slow and this will usually produce a signal line crossover at the extremities. Volatility in the underlying security can also increase the number of crossovers.",

The moving average, which forms the base for this indicator, can be a simple or exponential moving average. Each envelope is then set the same percentage above or below the moving average.

However, this indicator is not limited to just trend following. The envelopes can also be used to identify overbought and oversold levels when the trend is relatively flat.  Indicators based on channels, bands and envelopes are designed to encompass most price action. Therefore, moves above or below the envelopes warrant attention. Trends often start with strong moves in one direction or another. A surge above the upper envelope shows extraordinary strength, while a plunge below the lower envelope shows extraordinary weakness. Such strong moves can signal the end of one trend and the beginning of another.  With a\u00a0 moving average \u00a0as its foundation, Moving Average Envelopes are a natural trend-following indicator. As with moving averages, the envelopes will lag price action. The direction of the moving average dictates the direction of the channel. In general, a downtrend is present when the channel moves lower, while an uptrend exists when the channel moves higher. The trend is flat when the channel moves sideways.  Sometimes a strong trend does not take hold after an envelope break and prices move into a trading range. Such trading ranges are marked by a relatively flat moving average. The envelopes can then be used to identify overbought and oversold levels for trading purposes. A move above the upper envelope denotes an overbought situation, while a move below the lower envelope marks an oversold condition.",

The most popular choices are: 38, 50, 100 and 200 days.

When two arithmetic averages are used, whereby one is a short-term and the other a long-term, more interesting signals can be generated. One such application can be seen with Richard Donchian\u2019s methodologies, such as using the 5 and 20-day averages.\nThe Double Crossover Method generates signals in the following way:  If the short-term average crosses the long-term average from below, this is called a Golden Cross, and a buy signal is generated. Higher trading volume reinforces the quality of the signal. The long-term average works as a support line in an uptrend.  If the short-term average crosses the long-term average from above, this is called a Death Cross. It generates a sell signal. Higher trading volume reinforces the signal quality. In a downtrend, the long-term average functions as a resistance line.  Crossing of three moving averages  Another method is to use three moving averages (Triple Crossover Method). This method was presented by R.C Allen, who used the 4, 9, and 18-day averages and suggested that a trend change is hinted at when the 4MA crosses the 9MA from bottom to top. An entry is only recommended when all lines are above the 18-day period. An exit is initiated when the 4-day MA moves below the 9-day MA.  (Source: VTAD)",

Fundamentally speaking, the length of the period affects the intensity of the smoothing. Shorter periods (e.g. 10 days) will result in the indicator following the price changes relatively closely.  The simple moving average has a couple of drawbacks, which is why several permutations of this indicator have been developed over the course of the years. Primarily, one of the biggest drawbacks is the lagging nature of the indicator and the equal weighting for all data inputs across the time intervals.

A rising OBV reflects positive volume pressure that can lead to higher prices. Conversely, falling OBV reflects negative volume pressure that can foreshadow lower prices. Granville noted in his research that OBV would often move before price. Expect prices to move higher if OBV is rising while prices are either flat or moving down. Expect prices to move lower if OBV is falling while prices are either flat or moving up.  The absolute value of OBV is not important. Chartists should instead focus on the characteristics of the OBV line. First define the trend for OBV. Second, determine if the current trend matches the trend for the underlying security. Third, look for potential support or resistance levels. Once broken, the trend for OBV will change and these breaks can be used to generate signals. Also notice that OBV is based on closing prices. Therefore, closing prices should be considered when looking for divergences or support/resistance breaks. And finally, volume spikes can sometimes throw off the indicator by causing a sharp move that will require a settling period. (Source: Stockcharts.com)",

Point 2 is often situated at the high of a bar, and point 3 at the low of the same bar. Depending on the timeframe and the fluctuation range, T0 and T1 are fused into one.  The indicator identifies the selected timeframe of the chart, and all trends and trend sizes are labeled accordingly. In times of low volatility, the trend recognition is more sensitive, and the opposite is true for higher volatility. The adaptive methods ensure a balanced recognition of trend sizes.  Important tip:  In some cases the large trend (T0) is not visible, which may sometimes be due to the fact that not enough candles are visible within the chart. A minimum of 500 candles should be loaded in order to ensure this is not the case.",

Wilder called this the \"Parabolic Time/Price System.\" SAR stands for \"stop and reverse,\" which is the actual indicator used in the system.\u00a0 SAR trails price as the trend extends over time. \u00a0The indicator is below prices when prices are rising and above prices when prices are falling. In this regard, the indicator stops and reverses when the price trend reverses and breaks above or below the indicator.  Wilder introduced the Parabolic Time/Price System in his 1978 book,\u00a0 New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems . This book also includes\u00a0RSI, Average True Range (ATR), and the Directional Movement Concept (ADX). Despite being developed before the computer age, Wilder's indicators have stood the test of time and remain extremely popular.  SAR follows price and can be considered a trend-following indicator. Once a downtrend reverses and starts up, SAR follows prices like a trailing stop. The stop continuously rises as long as the uptrend remains in place. In other words, SAR never decreases in an uptrend and continuously protects profits as prices advance. The indicator acts as a guard against the propensity to lower a stop-loss. Once price stops rising and reverses below SAR, a downtrend starts and SAR is above the price. SAR follows prices lower like a trailing stop. The stop continuously falls as long as the downtrend extends. Because SAR never rises in a downtrend, it continuously protects profits on\u00a0short positions. (Source: Stockcharts.com)",

The aim is to define price levels that can be used as potential resistance (R1..R3) or support zones (S1..S3).\nThe indicator can be calculated using the following methods:\nClassic, Floor, Woodie, Camarilla, Fibonacci. The calculatory steps are outlined below.\nThe Classic and Floor methods are often wrongly named within literature, which is why in AgenaTrader you will find that the Classic method is labeled as \u201cFloor\u201d and vice versa.\nThe indicator shows the pivot points for intraday charts, and the \u201cShowPrices\u201d parameter allows you to display the price on the levels. The \u201cDaysBack\u201d parameter allows you to set the number of periods in the past that should be used for the calculation. The line coloring can be defined manually.",

Also referred to as %R, Williams %R reflects the level of the close relative to the highest high for the look-back period. In contrast, the Stochastic Oscillator reflects the level of the close relative to the lowest low. %R corrects for the inversion by multiplying the raw value by -100. As a result, the Fast Stochastic Oscillator and Williams %R produce the exact same lines, only the scaling is different. Williams %R oscillates between 0 to -100. Readings from 0 to -20 are considered overbought. Readings from -80 to -100 are considered oversold. Unsurprisingly, signals derived from the Stochastic Oscillator are also applicable to Williams %R.

            "text": "As with the Stochastic Oscillator, Williams %R reflects the level of the close relative to the high-low range over a given period of time. Assume that the highest high equals 110, the lowest low equals 100 and the close equals 108. The high-low range is 10 (110 - 100), which is the denominator in the %R formula. The highest high less the close equals 2 (110 - 108), which is the numerator. 2 divided by 10 equals 0.20. Multiply this number by -100 to get -20 for %R. Williams %R would equal -30 if the close was 103 (0.30 x -100).  The centerline, -50, is an important level to watch. Williams %R moves between 0 and -100, which makes -50 the midpoint. Think of it as the 50 yard line in football. The offense has a higher chance of scoring when it crosses the 50 yard line. The defense has an edge as long as it prevents the offense from crossing the 50 yard line. A Williams %R cross above -50 signals that prices are trading in the upper half of their high-low range for the given look-back period. This suggests that the cup is half full. Conversely, a cross below -50 means prices are trading in the bottom half of the given look-back period. This suggests that the cup is half empty.  Low readings (below -80) indicate that the price is near its low for the given time period. High readings (above -20) indicate that the price is near its high for the given time period.",
